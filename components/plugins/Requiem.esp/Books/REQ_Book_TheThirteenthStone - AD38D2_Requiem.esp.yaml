    <p align="left">My limbs stiffen, and the sky grows cold. I must write, while I still can.


    I am Cyrus Arman, a mage and scholar of Cyrodiil, and unwillingly a student of the stones of Skyrim.


    We have copies of "Watcher of Stones" in the University, of course. It was known that for certain individuals, the stones did indeed respond. I knew, reading it, that I would be one such person. I thought perhaps the Mage stone, outside of Riverwood, might be mine, or perhaps one of its charges.


    The Guardian stones were the easiest to find. I came to them without much incident, and passing through from Bruma to the town of Helgen. Understand; we of the University take a rigorous approach to our investigations, and thus it was that I worked through the stones from left to right, as I came to them.


    As I touched the Thief, expecting nothing, I felt it. It was a blessing, but dark and deeper than anything I had imagined. I had a brief sense of quiet, mischievous joy. Fingers, quick in pockets. Sliding through the shadows. Locks gliding open, just a little, making a complex lock simple and a simple one opened by even those with no skill at all, like myself. There was something piercing in it, too; I felt the sharpness of the little dagger I wore, and knew it would extend to smaller swords, or even axes and hammers, and to a bow that I had never once wielded, but for which I had a sudden, unexpected desire.


    Beaming at my discovery, I reached eagerly for the Mage stone.


    Was touching a stone enough to set my fate in it? I do not know. The Mage was nothing more than rock to me. I stared at it for a long time, my hand resting on the damp, cold moss. I moved to the Warrior; even that was preferable to the guilt that accompanied my new-found sense of skill. The Warrior gave me nothing, either. I had a blessing, but it was not one I cared for.


    Thus it was that I determined to find the others. There were twelve stones, we knew; twelve, for the twelve constellations of the sky. I have found them all. As I said, I will not share all their locations. My limbs stiffen, and the sky grows cold. I have little time.


    I went first to the west, and found the Lover stone. It took the blessing of the Thief stone from me, leaving me with a strange charisma in its place. I saw the worth of those I spoke to, and gave my own in return. I was, I realised, quite charming. My smile came easy to my face, though not without removing the sense of mischief that wove through it. It was a blessing, though. Perhaps, I thought, other stones might also respond.


    I found the Apprentice. Nothing.


    The Shadow answered, letting me slip through dark and light alike, completely unseen. The masters of Illusion would have been fascinated.


    The Ritual, close to Whiterun, did nothing.


    It was when I finally discovered the location of the Tower that I met the other travellers: a Dunmer refugee, small and slight, and a Nord. The place was bitterly cold, and the wind vicious as any of the frost spells I wielded. I approached, showing my hands unarmed, and they invited me to their fire.


    "We came for the Tower stone," the Dunmer said. "I am Llorvase."


    The Nord stuck out a big hand. "Enrik."


    "Have you tried it?" I asked, anxiously.


    They nodded, and from their faces I could tell that nothing had come to them. I went to the stone and placed my hand on it.


    It was as deep as the Thief that I had first experienced. It did not just give me access to the hidden places, but it was a hidden place itself. I felt as if I might vanish from existence at any point, with the knowledge inside of me. A charge of the Thief it certainly was, but it gave me no stealth, nor piercing. Instead, it was as if the locks... they simply had no purpose. All the places were also my palace. I could see within chests and behind locked doors, as if I already stood there, in all places, while still standing on that snowy slope. The locks were meaningless. I closed my eyes and tried to embrace the feeling, but could not do so perfectly. Perhaps one who was adept at picking locks already could have mastered any door. I do not know, nor will I ever be able to try it.


    I picked up my pack, feeling it light and easy in my hands, as if some part of it had also moved out of existence. The others could see, in my face, that something had changed. "What happened?" Llorvase asked.


    I explained the sensations I had felt, and she laughed. "It is ironic," she said. "I am a thief, and yet it's the stones of the Mage and its charges that respond to me."


    She shared the effects of the stones she had felt. The Mage stone, in Riverwood, had allowed her to draw in more of the magic of Aetherius. "I could have cast some big spells... if I knew any. It's the Apprentice I prefer," she said. "We Dunmer don't mind fire so much, and while the stone may have made me more vulnerable to that magic... well, all magic really... look how much more quickly I can draw it in." She demonstrated, filling her hands with light, then letting it die, then doing it again and again. She sighed as she let the little glowing sphere settle behind her shoulder. "That's almost the only spell I know. There was another I could have learned, but... ugh." She told me of the Ritual stone, and the woman she had found there, guarding it. "Every skeleton in the place came to life at her call," Llorvase said. "I ran."


    "Did you visit the Atronach stone?" I asked her, and when she nodded, grinning, I insisted, "I must know how you got past the guardian there."


    "I'm a thief," she laughed, again. "Atronachs are stupid. It wasn't hard. You don't want it, though. Ah, I felt it in me. So much power! I felt as if I could cast even the greatest spell with ease... but no magic came to me. It was as if I had been emptied out. It was only when the atronach turned back, and hit me with a bolt of lightning, that I felt my magic return to me."


    "What did you do?"


    "The only other spell I know is a ward, so I cast that. A good thing too, because the second spell did not fill my magic. It just hurt. It looks as if half the time it works, and half the time it doesn't. I went back to find the Apprentice Stone again before coming here."


    I thanked her for saving me the time and trouble. "How about you, Enrik?" I asked.


    "Well," he began slowly, "I joined the Stormcloaks...."


    "Ah. A warrior."


    His smile fell into a thin line, and he shrugged. "Of course." I thought at the time he simply didn't like the swiftness of my categorization of his race and allegiance.


    "Are you also bound to the Warrior and his charges? What are they like?" We both listened eagerly.


    "A few of the Stormcloaks are bound to them," he said, "and like you, they cannot choose any other. The Warrior grants skill in battle, as you might expect. Any weapon, including bows."


    I nodded, remembering the lethal keenness of weapons that the Thief stone had provided to me.


    "The Lady... she makes you fast. It isn't as if you're strong, but your strength recovers more quickly. You can run faster, catch your breath." He spoke in short words, his accent strong on his tongue.


    "And the Lord?" Llorvase asked.


    "Harder skin. Harder against magic, too. The Steed makes you stronger, simple as that. You can run further, though you won't recover any more quickly than if you were just that strong anyway."


    "Can you carry more?" I asked, thinking of the lightness of my pack. He shook his head.


    "They all sound useful, though, for a Stormcloak," I said. "What brought you out here? Or did you come for the Shrine of Talos? I'm not judging," I added quickly. "I'm a mage, not a politician."


    "Yes," he grunted. "That was it. I was thinking, though, of going to the Warrior stone. I haven't tried that one; just heard about it from the others. I am a Nord. If I'm not a warrior, what am I?"


    "I'm heading south," I told him. "I've seen them all. I'll be taking the pass to Bruma, if you want to come with me."


    He nodded. We bid farewell to Llorvase, then set off the next morning.


    We reached the stones after a few days of travel. It was cold; bitterly cold. It still is. My fingers tremble as I hold this quill. I must write the last of it, while I can. I hope that I can.


    The stones... they draw you in. I do not know what it was that made me touch the Thief stone again. As I lie here, I tell myself that I wanted only to try its power. I tell myself that my fingers on Enrik's purse were nothing more than an experiment, no different to any other. The desire that came with it, though, was overwhelming.


    Truly, I think that perhaps I was always meant to be a thief. They say that thieves are driven by their luck, and that eventually, it runs out. They live shorter lives, compared to others. It would make sense. My life is almost over, now. This warning is the only legacy I can leave.


    Enrik caught me. He spat at me, on my face, and my legs gave way immediately. I gasped. It was hard to breathe. He stared down at me, contemptuous. I stared back, uncomprehending.


    "There is a thirteenth stone," he told me. "The Stormcloaks sent me to it, and this is the gift it has given me. It is... dark. It is a darkness that moves through the stars and between them. It is mortality. It is death." I saw the sorrow there, then, and the haunted shadow in his eyes. He put his hand on the Warrior stone, and the faint flicker of a smile flashed across his face; but it was a smile of resignation, not delight. He moved past me, touching the Mage, and then the Thief. Then he came back, and he shrugged. "Everything I knew of the Warrior stone and its charges, I knew from others. These were the last stones for me, in the whole of Skyrim. I am blessed by the Serpent, and no other."


    "I am... sorry..." I managed.


    "Yes," he responded. He looked down at me. "I have never seen sorrier. You should not have tried to steal from me." He looked up at the clouded sky. The rain had ice in it, and was turning to snow. Somewhere I could hear a long, low howl. "If the weather does not take you," he said, "the wolves will do the job. I will be long gone from here by then. Farewell, Thief." Then he walked away.


    I did not know that there was a thirteenth stone, and that, the darkest stone of all.


    Enrik, if that was his name, told it true. The poison has killed me, and the snow has killed me, and so have the stones. I cannot walk, and even my arms are weak. Each breath is harder than the last. I try to call, but my voice is thin, and only the wolves answer. They are close, now.


    My limbs stiffen, and the sky grows cold.
