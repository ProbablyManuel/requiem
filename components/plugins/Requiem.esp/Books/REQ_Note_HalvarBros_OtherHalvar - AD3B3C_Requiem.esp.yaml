    Halvar,


    Couldn't have been me blinded Ulfr, because I don't remember doing it. And if I don't remember, it didn't happen. So it must have been you. Who's mixing who up now?


    Keep the ring. I've still got my hammer, and you left your share of the mead in the Lost Knife Cave, so I've got that too. Lots of mead! And it's all mine. Except the bottle from yesterday. And the one from this morning. Or maybe it was two. Well, there's plenty left!


    See you in Sovngarde!


    This Halvar.
