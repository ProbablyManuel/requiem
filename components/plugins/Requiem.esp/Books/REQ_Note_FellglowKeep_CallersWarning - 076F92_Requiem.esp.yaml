    <font face='$HandwrittenFont'>To all initiates,


    It seems some of you were foolish enough to disturb our new guests.


    I have heard the rumor that they must be desperate, to ally themselves with us. Whether true or not, the note on the door is not for their benefit, but for yours. To prevent any further accidents, I have locked the door. The key is in my personal store room. You're welcome to try and take it. I should warn you though that several of our guests have acquired a taste for human and elf flesh.


    I don't think they've tried cat yet. Leave that lock alone.


    - The Caller
