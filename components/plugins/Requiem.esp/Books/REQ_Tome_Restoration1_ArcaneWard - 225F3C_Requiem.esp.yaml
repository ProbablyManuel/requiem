    Lesser Ward


    <font size='12'>Concentrate on the barrier to keep it in front of you. As spells strike it, the ward will weaken, but they will be nullified. You must maintain your focus to rebuild the ward. If the power of the spell that strikes your ward is too powerful, it will overwhelm it. You will be cast backwards as the ward fails.
