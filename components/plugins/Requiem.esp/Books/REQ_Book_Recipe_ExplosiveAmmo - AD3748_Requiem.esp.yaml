    <img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/T_letter.png'>here was once a banker in Cyrodiil who warned me against over-investing in anything that was turning sour. She spoke of the times she had seen good money poured after bad, and the unwillingness of both Mer and Men to relinquish that which they had once favoured. I think it was the memory of her that saved me from those last few chambers in Kemel-Ze, for without remembering her words I would have certainly stayed and dared its dangers, and probably died in the process.


    After we defeated the great effigy of the Dwemer king, the doorway which he had been guarding was open to us. A wide passage led onwards, buttressed by pillars banded with that strange Dwemer metal. For some distance it weaved its way through the rock, avoiding unseen geological obstacles, until it opened out into a great arched cavern. Constructs high above us held lights that still glowed, even after all these years in the dark. In that white luminescence we could see that there were further doors at the far end, but we never had the chance to explore them. As I stepped out, something flew from the opposite end of the room and pinned my robe to the stone floor. I knelt to free myself, but even as I did so, I felt the crackle of lightning across my fingers. I gasped in pain and felt my magic flee me. Another bolt slammed into the wall beside my head, but the explosive power of this second bolt was significantly greater, and I found myself knocked off my feet.


    It was Tuen Panai who saved me, tearing my robe free and dragging me backwards into the corridor. The lithe Dark Elf was quicker than any of us, and seemed to shrug off any sense of danger. Having pulled me back, he determined to poke his own head out into the space.


    He came back with one of the bolts held carefully between finger and forethumb, so that we were able to see it. Without touching the head, he showed us the hollow point. As I have detailed in the accompanying drawings, this bolt had four delicate arms, within which some magical substance had been imprisoned. We spent some time passing it around and commenting on its strange power.


    Further attempts to enter the space were met with similar ferocity. Panai seemed determined to recover one of the more explosive bolts, or at least its shrapnel, but Roland Nordssen persuaded him to leave it alone and I echoed the sentiment. We had plenty of wealth with which to return to Cyrodiil, and no need to risk our lives for further gain.


    That bolt was the last of the artifacts we took from Kemel-Ze. As with the other Dwemer constructs returned to the Imperial capital, it resisted attempts at breaking down the metal, and until we discovered the trick of Dwemer smithing as mentioned in my previous volume, we were unable to free the captured substance. Eventually, though, it revealed itself to be nothing more than a small glass bead. Some resinous substance had been smeared around the outside, and around that was a shell of void salts - rare, but not unknown to Imperial conjurers. Our experiments with fire and ice salts have proved that the smithing technique may be used with any properties of Destructive magic, provided that the glue used to keep them in place is organic in nature. With further experimentation we were able to prove that the magic of the bolts was entirely separate from the metal, and the Imperial fletchers have successfully transferred the knowledge to their arrows. It is only the rarity of the salts themselves that keeps us from similarly arming every archer.


    For myself, and for Roland Nordssen, the archaeolgical mysteries that we had uncovered were recompense enough for our endeavours, and we are both famous as a result through the whole Empire. The two of us never did return to that chamber, to risk again those strange machines and their ferocious attacks. Another expedition was sent after a few years, and found the great crossbows silent. The rooms beyond were empty. I heard from their reports that in the place where the corridor emerged, and where I had been pinned and almost killed, the floor and the wall were both scored and shattered as if a thousand bolts had landed there. It must have taken considerable patience to exhaust the machines, and more still to gather up every bolt carefully between finger and thumb.


    It was only much later that I heard the rumours from Vvardenfel, of missiles whose explosive power was far in excess of anything we could conjure, reminiscent of that bolt whose power knocked me from my feet there in the depths. I spent a fair fraction of my fortune attempting to track down one of these "Ten Penny" bolts, and to find Tuen Panai himself, until the memory of my banker friend surfaced once more and I decided to cease the investment.


    I would give much to find that lost art. Dwemer ruins score the rock beneath us deeply, and we have not explored them all. Perhaps some future generation of archaeologists as intrepid and fearless as Panai will discover it.


    For now though, the elusive Dunmer has vanished, and with him, the last of the secrets of Kemel-Ze.
