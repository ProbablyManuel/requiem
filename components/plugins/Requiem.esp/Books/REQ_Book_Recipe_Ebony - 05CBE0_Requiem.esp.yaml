    It was originally assumed that "ebony" was so named because of the visual similarity to the wood of the ebony tree. This dark hardwood is dense enough that it sinks in water, and perhaps a more gullible smith might mistake it for metal. In Hammerfell, certainly, both the Ra Gada and the Orsimer pariah folk share similar stories of travellers, usually outsiders, who pay vast sums for the secrets of ebony smithing, only to return home and spend the rest of their fortune burning hardwood in the forge and wondering why they cannot achieve the same results.


    These tales are, of course, nothing more than bigotry. Smiths of any worth are familiar with ebony ore. It is a dense, black glass, with a similar appearance to jet, but which is far harder. Additionally, its origins are volcanic in nature, and this may provide another explanation for the name.


    Ebony ore has, by the time it is mined, already undergone greater heating than most forges can generate. The fires beneath the surface of Tamriel are fierce. Stories of the creation of ebony are often woven through with stories of Lorkhan's fall, and many still believe the substance to be the petrified blood of the gods themselves. Ebony ore does not melt readily, and cannot be softened in the same way as metal. It is a glass, albeit heavy and strong, and must be fully liquid when worked. The same techniques which provide molds for other heavy armors are useful, but the liquid glass must be blown into the mold or laid down as sheets in order to be shaped. Hammers can be used gently as the glass cools to help press it into shape, but striking ebony will either dent it when soft, or cause it to crack if hammered while cooling. Unlike metals such as steel and orichalcum, ebony cannot be folded, nor does it need to be. Once fully cooled, a sheet of ebony is almost impenetrable.


    For melting the ebony, superlative bellows are required to produce the necessary airflow in the forge. Additionally, the fuel used to forge ebony must be far hotter than ordinary wood can provide. The more dense the fuel, the more air is required to keep it burning, and the hotter the flame that is provided. Ebony wood is one of the most dense fuels known, and to be able to set a fire using the wood is, in itself, something of an art. Perhaps it was the wood, rather than the blackness of the ore, that originally lent its name to the craft we now call "ebony smithing."
