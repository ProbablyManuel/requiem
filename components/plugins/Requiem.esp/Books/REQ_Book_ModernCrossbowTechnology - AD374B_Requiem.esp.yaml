    <img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/A_letter.png'>fter the encounter in the storm, I took to traveling with others on the road wherever possible. The Thalmor allow me to follow them at a distance, while Stormcloaks threaten to draw their blades despite my connections in Windhelm. The Legion are a little more tolerant. The Khajiit are the most amiable. I once tried to travel with some of the Forsworn, but that turned out to be an unwise decision that I may one day tell in another volume.


    Recently, though, a new group of travelers has been walking the roads. These Dawnguard are not soldiers in the pay of any lord, but volunteers. Some few of them are mages. The others have a technology sufficiently advanced to compete with the best of Winterhold.


    We were close to Shor's Stone in the Rift when a creature ran at us from the wood. It was a hound, but so scarred and emaciated that it seemed almost skeletal. Behind it, baring teeth that were equally sharp, were two vampires. Those poor souls who contract the disease and cannot find a cure in time must make a choice: to feed, to suffer the pangs of hunger that plague their kind, or to die. If they cannot or will not feed they become desperate for blood, and will attack anyone who passes.


    This I learnt afterwards from Durak, an Orc who has left his tribe to join the volunteers in the fight against the vampires. He raised his crossbow, and while one of his comrades stepped forward to take on the strange hound, he calmly shot one of the vampires in the heart, reloaded, took aim, and fired again. The second was close enough that I could see the red of her eyes, but she fell silently as the bolt pierced her through. Durak merely loaded another bolt, ready for the next predator.


    The crossbow looked unusual, and I asked if I could see it. Durak showed me the mechanism that helped him to draw back the string then release it. It was done more swiftly than any of the city guards, and impressive even for an Orc of his strength. I told him as much.


    "Those Nord crossbows are strong enough," Durak grunted, "but not fast enough. This second one would have had her teeth in a guardsman's neck. You've got an even bigger problem if there are three vampires... or you're a poor shot."



    "What of the Dwemer crossbows?" I asked him, thinking of those I'd seen on display in Markarth. "Why would you not use those?"


    Durak laughed. "Those aren't Dwemer," he said. "They're steel with a few Dwemer metal attachments. I met a woman once who's seen the real Dwarf bows. She reckons there's a way to replicate their arts. This was her design." He patted the bow as if it were a pet. "The last we saw of her, she was off into the ruins to find their schematics. Isran told her she had less sense than a Riekling, but she had less fear as well." He grinned, his big tusks shining in the light of my torch, and then his smile fell. "Look out," he said, and he smoothly wound the bow and aimed it over my shoulder.



    I flinched away as the bolt flew, and the vampire that had crept up behind me fell.


    "Three," Durak commented, and grinned again. "Just like magic."
