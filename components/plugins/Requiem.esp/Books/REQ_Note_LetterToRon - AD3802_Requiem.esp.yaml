    </font>I told you. If you tell me to get away from you one more time, I said, we're done. You didn't listen, and now we're done.<font size='6'>


    </font>It's all very convenient for you when I'm snuggled up in your blankets at night, isn't it? Then as soon as it's something I want, it's "Get away from me! Get away from me! Get away from me!" I swear, you say that so much, one of these days you're going to end up enchanting something with it by accident. I hope you do. I hope it leaves you too.<font size='6'>


    </font>I'm going up to join Hajvarr. He's a real man and his sword's twice the size of yours. Not that it matters. All I wanted was a damned hug.<font size='6'>


    </font>Your <i>former</i> lover,

    Furava.
