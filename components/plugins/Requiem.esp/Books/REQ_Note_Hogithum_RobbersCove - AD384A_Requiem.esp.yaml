    </font><font size='17'>With three beers down the Orc did frown,

    And bid the Elf goodbye,

    For none could know 'twas not for show

    And someone had to die.

    He cast the knife, then caught the life

    That trickled from the glaive

    And with a spell he summoned well

    The Elf back from the grave.<font size='7'>


    </font>With four beers down the Elf did clown

    And bow and scrape and smile.

    "It's sleight of hand, you understand,"

    The Orc said, full of guile.

    "Just stand up here, and be of cheer,

    Your subjects entertained,

    My hand is quick, the knife a trick,

    The death entirely feigned."
