    Halvar,


    I went to White River Watch yesterday. They wouldn't speak to me at first. Told me they'd heard how I drank too much Honningbrew, got angry, and blinded poor Ulfr for good.


    You know what? I'm done with everyone mixing us up. I'm heading for Duskglow and taking the ring with me. Keep your bloody hammer. If you don't bash your own brains out, maybe someone else can do it for you.


    I hope you rot.

    The other Halvar.
