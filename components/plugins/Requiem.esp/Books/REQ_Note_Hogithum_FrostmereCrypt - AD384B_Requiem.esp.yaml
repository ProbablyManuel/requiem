    </font><font size='17'>With one beer down they looked around

    And found her in the stand;

    They showed the trick, not true magic

    But merely sleight of hand.

    The Elf himself stood on a shelf

    With trust in his friend's aim;

    Knives thrown so well 'twas like a spell

    And certain of acclaim.<font size='7'>


    </font>With two beers down she took her crown

    And laid it on the shelf.

    "They'll say I fear to volunteer

    Unless I come myself.

    But show me now exactly how

    Your volunteers survive;

    A fool I'd be to enter free

    And fail to leave alive."
