    After searching for months, my luck is finally turning. I've located the <Alias=Item> in Skyrim. The mercenary told me to look at the <Alias=Dungeon>. But I must be very careful, because this place is guarded by a <Alias.ShortName=Boss>. This looks like a safe place; I'll make camp here and start tomorrow.
