    Preamble


    Greetings to you, honored reader!


    By holding these pages in your hands, you truly possess the best catalogue of information on all of Skyrim's beasts, be them small or big, common or rare! For I, the great wizard and scholar Thalantyr of Daggerfall, have shown no remorse or idleness to gather and verify every single fact about those monstrosities that dwell in these harsh lands! But I shan't trouble you with more unnecessary words - behold, and read with care, as these facts might one day save your very life when facing these creatures!







    Animals


    Before we shall delve in details, let it be noted that almost any animal might be infected with potent diseases that could even cause a mighty warrior to decay within days. Thus, I can only advise you to have the means at hand to cure such vile afflictions, as they can affect the victim's body almost immediately after the contraction, as they posses a truly unique magical nature. 















    The Bear


    Skyrim is home of many bears, with many variations depending on the given territory. As worldly creatures, they do not possess any magical traits worth mentioning - however, any wanderer should show the greatest amount of caution when close to these beasts, as they can run very fast - faster than one might think! And they certainly are able to tear an unarmored foe to shreds if they are able to hit them with their sharp claws. The best way to deal with them certainly is through magic or another form of ranged combat. 

    It also should be noticed that some of their intestines, especially their hearts, can be used in alchemical experiments, as can their claws.



    The Horker


    Horkers are a common form of life at Skyrim's coasts. Their appearance is somewhat hard to describe, as no similar creature has ever been seen in all of Tamriel. They're very slow beings that only attack when feeling threatened - although they can be fought very easily with ranged weaponry because of their lack of fast movement, one should not dare to underestimate the force of their tusks, as they certainly are capable of killing a human-like being with just a few blows. Also, their body is very durable, consisting of thick layers of muscles and fat, which makes them die rather slowly if not hit very powerfully.

    Whatever way one chooses to approach them, it should be mentioned that their fat can be used as a substitute for troll fat, as they basically share the same magical properties.














    The Mammoth


    Mammoths are found a plenty on the plains of Skyrim, either roaming the land wildly or being domesticated by the local giants. They're most likely the biggest animals that walk the landscape, and their steps can make the very earth tremble. Their thick skin and pure mass of muscles and strong bones gives them exceptionally high resistances to damage of all sorts, and common arrows most likely won't do them much harm as they hardly can injure important organs - because of this, they're best killed by fighting them in groups or luring them into traps like spike pits.

    It is highly advisable to not engage in melee combat, as a single blow of their mighty tusks can penetrate armor easily and impale even a hardened orcish veteran.

    The Mudcrab


    As in many other provinces, mudcrabs can also be found in Skyrim, though their appearance differs from those that dwell in the lands of Cyrodiil and Morrowind, as their carapaces tend to be blue-grey and lack the common green-brown tone.

    Depending on their age, Skyrim's mudcrabs can be found in many sizes, from very small to very large, though they rarely become any bigger. Although there are claims of at least one mudcrab being as tall as a house in Skyrim's northern coast regions, these most likely are fairytales.

    Their size determines their overall strength in combat -  the bigger they are, the harder they are to kill and the harder they hit. When facing them, magical damage is the best way to deal with them, as their very hard carapaces provide an exceptional amount of protection that will withstand most common weapons. If magic is not available, a skilled warrior might also try a mace or some other form of blunt weapon, as the sheer force of such blows can damage the internal organs of these creatures, rendering their protection practically useless.



    The Sabrecat


    Sabrecats are a terror to behold, as they're both fast and deadly - although they do not withstand as many blows as bears, they still are hard to kill if they're not surprised by the attacker. They should only be approached by experienced hunters, as they'll tear anyone to shreds who is unfortunate enough to be exposed to their claws.

    The Skeever


    Looking somewhat like the giant rats that dwell in Cyrodiil, Morrowind, Highrock and other provinces, Skeevers are the representation of these creatures in the land of Skyrim. They are rather small and a little skittish and will only prove to be a nuisance for anyone who can (and does) carry a weapon of any sort.

    The Slaughterfish


    As they can be found in many provinces, Slaughterfish are also a common sight in Skyrim's waters. Their teeth are as sharp as they are anywhere else, though, and can tear flesh from bone effortlessly. It's highly advised not to venture too far into these waters - if it's necessary, they should be lured to a good position and then be dispatched with arrows. The best option is, however, to blast them to smitherines with a fireball or something similar, as these creatures generally die rather quickly.

    A rather rare form of this specimen, the giant slaughterfish, has been reported to be seen from time to time in the lands of Skyrim, though they generally can only be found in the oceans. These monstrosities are a whole other form of challenge, as they can even destroy entire ships with their gigantic jaws. Those who are unfortunate enough to face such things most likely are about to be swallowed whole.









    The Wolf


    Probably the most common creature in Skyrim's forests and tundra, the Wolf is a dangerous beast that moves very fast and can kill with a few strong bites, but even a novice in the arts of combat should have no great challenge to kill one or two of them. However, if they are attacking in packs, they'll try to outmaneuver their prey, which can prove to be fatal to even more experienced adventurers - it is crucial to look out for them, and if possible, kill them with ranged weaponry.











    Constructs & Automatons


    Automatons are constructs of dwarven origin and can most often be found in dwemer ruins. Those encountered in Skyrim seem to be magically operated, as soul gems can be found in their remains, but how they function as a whole remains a secret. In general, they all share a strong resistance to physical damage

    due to their massive metal bodies, but can be dispatched relatively easily with shock based spells and enchantments, probably because they disrupt the magic that animates them.











    The Dwarven Centurion


    The Centurion is one of the greatest inventions of dwemic craftmanship and proves to be a very dangerous foe. It's massive metal body provides an exceptional protection from all forms of physical damage and is unpenetrable by common arrows, making unenchanted bows practically useless and turning every melee fight into a very long lasting encounter.

    It's only weakness seems to be electric energy, as the exposure to such seems to overcharge the construct and thereby destroying the magical mechanisms that keep it running. However, some if not all of them have the ability to shoot forth streams of hot steam that can cook human-like creatures alive. If one wants to approach them in melee combat, it's most likely suicide if the daredevil does not use some sort of fire protection.















    The Dwarven Sphere


    A less durable form of the dwarven automatons, the dwarven sphere is more common than the centurion. However, it's much faster and can maneuver much better than the former - most often, they are still patrolling in the more narrow sections of the dwarven ruins. They're generally equipped with a melee weapon and a crossbow, allowing them to either engage in close combat or attack from afar.














    The Dwarven Spider


    The weakest form of dwarven automatons. Shaped like a spider, they're also the smallest of constructs encountered. However, they are even faster than the Spheres and sometimes have an active crystal mounted on their top that is capable of producing lethal strikes of lightning. When approaching in large numbers, it is highly advised to either flee or make use of spells that damage multiple ones.














    Monsters


    Though some might admit that some of these are actually animals, the name "Monster" has been used by many scholars and mages to better depict the difference between magical creatures and those without any magic properties.





    The Chaurus


    A highly poisonous insectoid that shares some characteristics with a centipede. It is covered in a strong chitin shell that will decrease the effect of all physical damage significantly - for the greatest degree of effect, they should be fought with blunt weapons or with magic. 

    However, they are capable of spitting poison over many yards and therefore can be dangerous both at range or in melee, where they try to bite the target and thereby cause severe wounds.

    Protection from poison is highly advised when facing these monsters. Using poisons against them, however, is not advised, as they show a great resistance to it and also are immune to their own. 



    The Falmer


    The Falmer are humanoid-like creatures that dwell in Skyrim's underground areas, mostly in the parts of forsaken ruins of the dwemer. Without mentioning the astonishing history behind this race, it shall be noted that they're blind, yet can perceive their evironment exceptionally well via their other senses. They're highly intelligent and fight in groups while many of them also make use of potent poisons, making them formidable foes that aren't easily dispatched. However, they're somewhat vulnerable to fire - while, on the other hand, they're highly resistant to all kinds of poisons.

    They should be avoided by all but the most experienced adventurers.




    The Frostbite Spider


    These spiders are far more dangerous than those that dwell in the dungeons of High Rock, as they grow much larger and have an even thicker carapace. Their poison can easily kill an adult human and, if applied by their fangs, can also paralyze the victim if it is not protected greatly from poisons. Again, blunt weapons and magic are the best way to deal with their natural armor, however, they show a slight weakness to fire, which should be the prefered form of spell or enchantment if dealing with this specimen. 

    Using poisons against them, however, is not advised, as they show a great resistance to it and also are immune to their own, which only the most experienced alchemists can extract from their very unaccessible poison sacks. Amatures will only be able to collect their less potent spittle from their fangs.














    The Giant


    Giants are what their name suggests and can be found a plenty in the mountains and plains of Skyrim's landscape. Although most of them will only attack if one gets too close or they feel threatened, some might be more aggressive than others.

    Fighting them is a difficult task, however, as they can tear a human apart with their mere hands and become even more dangerous when using truly big weapons to crush their foes and knock down the entire vicinity.

    The structure of their body also differs greatly from that of humans internally, giving them a great protection from all kinds of arrows.







    The Hagraven


    Hagravens seem to be part woman and part raven. Generally, they're creatures that tend to practice witchcraft and therefore can relie on devastating spells during combat, though their sharp claws also give them an edge in melee. They should only be attacked with a high resistance to spells and at best, should be surprised, as they're rather weak when one can land the first blows before they start countering the attack. Additional caution is advised in melee, as they can also infect their victims with dangerous diseases.









    The Spriggan


    Spriggans are somewhat like Nymphs, but are more associated with forests and groves. They actually do look like they consist mostly of wood and arcane energies, however, this doesn't prevent them from having a weakness against fire.

    On the other hand, they also show great regenerative abilities that can only be surpressed by setting them ablaze.

    In combat, they generally attack the target with claws and poisonous spells, while quickly retreating and regenerating if heavily injured.










    The Troll


    Trolls are found in great numbers in Skyrim's caves, mountains and plains alike. This brute almost entirely consists of pure muscles and delivers devastating blows with its strong arms that can tear smaller creatures apart easily. Besides, like Spriggans, they possess exceptionally high rates of healing, making them very hard to kill with normal weapons. Fire again is the best way to face this foe.














    Undead



    All undead share the trait of being immune to worldy poisons and suffer much less from frost and electricity than most living creatures do. However, they're almost all suspectible to silvery weapons and "Turn Undead"  spells.




    The Draugr


    Almost always found in the ruins of the ancient nords, these creatures were once followers of the dragon cults, being lead by mighty sorcerers also known as dragon priests. 

    Basically, Draugrs share many characteristics with the common zombie found in many other provinces. They're very durable, as they no longer possess vulnerable organs and such; only severe dismemberment will stop them from functioning any longer, most likely because the magic animating them cannot be sustained after a certain degree of mutilation - therefore, the best way to deal with them in combat is using axes or swords, as blunt weapons don't work well on them. Also, non-magical bows and arrows will be of no use against this enemy - arrows are too small to cause dismemberment and also won't damage any organs, therefore, you could put a hundred arrows into one draugr without him stopping his furious charge. However, projectiles made from silver are still capable of dealing considerable amounts of damage to them...

    They're also highly resistant against frost and shock, though the latter shows a greater effect, probably because the lightning causes the disruption of the magic field that maintains their undeath, however, fire will cause overall damage to their rotten bodies, causing them to be quickly consumed by the flames - the best option to deal with them, besides certain spells of the school of restoration.

    Another strategy to deal with these creatures is to lure them into the traps that can be found in the ruins in which they reside, as they do not seem to possess enough intelligence to recognize them as a potential threat.












    The Ghost


    Ghosts are spirits that haunt this world for whatever reason. One should note that there are two varities of ghosts one must not mix up. The first one is the ethereal one that does not acutally exist physically in this world, causing it to be invulnerable and unable to interact with the enviroment of this realm. The other would be the ones that actually manifest themselves physically in this world by the use of ectoplasm, in which case they do possess a physical body that can be damaged by conventional means - however, ectoplasm behaves quite extraordinarily, as it's both harder than steel but more flexible than water as long as it's part of a ghost's body, causing the creature to be able to deliver dangerous blows while also being highly resistant to physical weapons - in fact, it's almost like hitting a body of water, blows do cause a sort of disruption, but it takes a lot of hits to destroy it entirely.

    Also, some ghosts seem to have traits that they once had in their real life, like ghostly trolls being able to regenerate their ectoplasmic body - in this case fire would behave the same as with living trolls.




    The Skeleton


    Skeletons are a form of weaker undead. They are easily destroyed by using a heavy blunt weapon like a warhammer and cannot withstand much damage in general, though arrows will sometimes just go through them without doing much damage. But when approaching in great numbers, it is advised to either be experienced in fighting groups or to have a powerful destruction spell at hand.













    The Vampire


    Vampires are known to reside throughout Tamriel and Skyrim is no exception. The most renowned local clan bears the name "Volkihar", though not much is known about their kin. As all vampires, they suffer much less from non-bladed weapons and are somewhat resistant to arrows. On the other hand, they do fear fire, for it causes severe damage to their bodies. Sunlight will also pose a threat to them, though it's not clear if they suffer as badly as other vampires from it.

    The real threat they pose, however, comes from their experience, as most vampires are very, very old - old enough to have studied probably all of the arcane schools to the very limits of Mundus or even beyond. Therefore, they almost all are foes incredibly skilled and thus, incredibly dangerous.

    Most importantly, one should not even think about using a holy symbol or garlic as protection, for the vampires will just laugh up their sleeve while tearing such a fool apart...
