  Value: <font face='$HandwrittenFont'>The secrets of working with the dragons' bones, their scales! We found them, lying just there - unguarded, in a long forgotten crypt! The almanac describes all we need to know to turn the dragon's very bodies against them! The smithing techniques, the refining process, the required material, everything! And what will it be for a mockery when we turn their slain brethren' skeletons against them, when we drive swords made of their own kind through their foul flesh!
