    </font>Thank you for sending word of Skulig's fate. He was a talented apprentice, if overly curious, and he will be missed. We have few enough Nords as it is.<font size='5'>


    </font>I'm sending replacement scrolls for the ones which were lost with him. I will also be asking Tolfdir to conduct a lesson on safety, so that our newest members don't make the same mistake. While protection may indeed be necessary in these ruins, it's imperative that our students appreciate the dangers of the magics we wield. Please ensure that everyone working in Saarthal understands that the contents of this chest are for emergency use only, and that the bound denizens of Oblivion do not take kindly to being used as targets for frost spells, even in short bursts.<font size='5'>


    </font>Savos Aren,

    Arch-mage.
