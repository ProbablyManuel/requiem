    They say the hair of dogs that bite 

    Will cure the bite itself; 

    Restorative magic 

    From a story-teller's shelf.


    So if you wake up aching 

    From the mead the night before,

    The way to cure it might be 

    Just to have a little more!


    But that's the thing of dog bites,

    For the dog that bit last night 

    Will try and bite again, but - 

    Just a taste won't hurt you, right?
