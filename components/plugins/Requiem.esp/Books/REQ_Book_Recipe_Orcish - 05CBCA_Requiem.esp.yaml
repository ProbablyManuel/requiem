    <img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/T_letter.png'>he forgewives of the Orcish strongholds have many songs, but the Almanac is the most popular. The twelve verses, reminiscent of the seasons and their associated constellations, also act as a reminder to apprentices and younger wives as to how to treat the hard metal of which the Orcish weapons and armor are made.


    Orcs are swift, strong and short-lived, but the forging itself is a slow, careful process. Rather than quenching the blades and armor, Orcs allow their works to cool slowly, on cold ground, in rain or in the high, cold air of the mountains. This prevents the different minerals in the orichalcum from separating, giving it resilience greater even than that of steel.


    The sixth and last verses are a reminder that even the strong Orcs must rest, though the ambiguity of the last verse is typical of Orcish philosophy.

    Snow on the hills,

    Blood in the forge,

    Symbols on stone.


    Fever and madness,

    Armor left cooling

    By a warm fire.


    Strong winds blow,

    Low, the flame,

    Careful, the hammer.


    Blessing of rain,

    The shaman sings.

    The hiss of steam.

    Bread with our meat.

    In the dark we feast

    By glowing embers.


    Warm sun, warm fire.

    Idle, the forge,

    Fast, the hunting.


    Cloudless skies.

    The child wields

    Her mother's hammer.


    Sickles and grindstones.

    The maces are heavy,

    The axes are sharp.

    [pagebreak]

    Always, fire burns

    If not in the forge

    Then in the heart.


    High in the mountains

    New swords breathe

    In the cold air.


    Long, the darkness.

    The sounds of the smithy

    Ring through our dreams.


    The heart is weary.

    Silently, the blade

    Finds its home.
