    </font><font size='17'>"That can't be true. You drank it too,"

    He said, and then he saw;

    She pulled the peg from out the keg

    And poured herself some more.

    "I like the taste, and hate to waste

    A decent bit of brew.

    No more pretence. My audience

    Are waiting there for you."<font size='7'>


    </font>With six beers down she raised her crown

    And placed it on her head,

    For no distill could ever kill

    A queen already dead.

    And in the stands the pallid hands

    Began a soft applause

    The Orc and Elf each joined himself,

    Obedient to her laws.
