    </font>Dear Harald,

    <font size='5'>


    </font>We're finally safe and I have a moment to write.

    <font size='5'>


    </font>The soldiers took everything in our farm. I don't even know which side they were on. They left us nothing, and I didn't like the way they were looking at Annja, so we had to go.

    <font size='5'>


    </font>I don't know when I'll get the chance to send this. We found some abandoned towers bridging the river near Whiterun, and we're settling here for the night. I think the trolls have lost our scent. I can hear them snuffling outside, but we've barricaded the door and they can't get in.

    <font size='5'>


    </font>Theyla and Annja are well, and send their love.

    <font size='5'>


    </font>Yours forever,

    Elsi.

    </font>Dear Harald,

    <font size='5'>


    </font>More refugees have come here. They're starving, but some of them have weapons so we went out hunting. There are a few rabbits and some wolves that we avoided.

    <font size='5'>


    </font>A merchant passed through today. He had plenty of food, but he wouldn't even share a mouthful with us. I hope the trolls get him.

    <font size='5'>


    </font>Theyla and Annja say they miss you. I hope I get a chance to send these letters so that you know where we are, then you can join us.

    <font size='5'>


    </font>Yours forever,

    Elsi.

    <font size='5'>


    </font>Dear Harald,

    <font size='5'>


    </font>We were hunting today. Theyla was attacked by a wolf hidden in the long grass, and she's badly hurt. The wound is infected. We have nothing here, no medicines or anything. I'm so afraid.

    <font size='5'>


    </font>Annja is crying. She's scared too, for all of us. There are eight of us here now, but we never have enough to eat, and the nights are cold.

    <font size='5'>


    </font>More merchants came by. The prices they charge are so high. I can't afford even a healing potion for Theyla. I don't know what we're going to do.

    <font size='5'>


    </font>I think of you often. If I get a chance, I'll go to Whiterun and send these letters, but for now I have to look after Theyla.

    <font size='5'>


    </font>Yours forever,

    Elsi.

    </font>Dear Harald,

    <font size='5'>


    </font>Today I killed a man.

    <font size='5'>


    </font>It was one of the merchants, coming past the road. His bag was full of medicines, and when I asked him, he showed me and laughed at me when I begged him to lower the price. Theyla is dying. I told him that, and he laughed some more. The next thing I knew, I had knocked him off his horse. He fell, and I hit him again. I kept hitting him. I had no idea that a simple staff could do so much damage.

    <font size='5'>


    </font>The others... they didn't stop me. We've all had enough. We took his weapons and armor. We killed his horse and we'll feast tonight. It's good to have something in our cookpot for a change.

    <font size='5'>


    </font>I threw the body down the waterfall for the trolls. At least they're good for something. I feel awful about the man, though. I didn't mean to kill him. Arkay forgive me; I just snapped.

    <font size='5'>


    </font>I hope you'll forgive me too.

    <font size='5'>


    </font>Yours forever,

    Elsi.

    <font size='5'>


    </font>Dear Harald,

    <font size='5'>


    </font>More merchants came past today, but now we're armed and armored. We stopped them and made them hand over food and gold and some of the medicine.

    <font size='5'>


    </font>It's too late, though. Theyla died last night. We took her downstream so the trolls can't get her.

    [pagebreak]

    I keep thinking about Whiterun. The merchants who came through told us that there's a bounty on our heads. They think we're bandits. I tried to tell them that we're just trying to survive, but the way they looked at us... it's hard to convince someone you've just robbed.

    <font size='5'>


    </font>We're not the only robbers around here, either. One of the merchants swore at us and showed us his saddlebags. They were already empty. I need to look into that.

    <font size='5'>


    </font>Yours forever,

    Elsi.

    Tirdas, 12th Sun's Height, 4E 201

    <font size='5'>


    </font>Dear Harald,

    <font size='5'>


    </font>We're clearing the road so that the merchants can get through. The trolls have been scared of us ever since we went down there with torches. Even Hajvarr Iron-Hand, up at White River Watch, is keeping his men up on the hill, and taking his raiding parties somewhere else, away from Whiterun and the road.

    <font size='5'>


    </font>It feels good to be doing something useful for the world, for a change. I think a couple of the merchants understand. One of them paid us without us having to draw a blade. As long as we don't kill without need, and as long as the civil war keeps going, maybe we can stay here. We're not charging so much, and everyone who passes here is safe.

    <font size='5'>


    </font>There are sixteen of us now. You should see Annja in her armor. You would be so proud of her. She sends her love.

    <font size='5'>


    </font>Yours forever,

    Elsi.

    Fredas, 6th Last Seed, 4E 201

    <font size='5'>


    </font>Dear Harald,

    <font size='5'>


    </font>Annja is dead. A bounty hunter came in search of us. He was alone, but so was Annja. I'm never leaving any of my men by the door on their own again.

    <font size='5'>


    </font>We put his head on a spike as a warning. I wish we had done that already. Maybe Annja would still be alive.

    <font size='5'>


    </font>I'm not going to send these letters. I don't want you to see what I've become. I've got a new family to protect, now. Some of them are as young as ours were.

    <font size='5'>


    </font>I don't remember, any more, what it was like to be young.

    <font size='5'>


    </font>I'm so sorry, my love. I never wanted any of this. Arkay grant that you never find me; that you believe me dead too. It's better that way. Sooner or later, someone will end up making it true.

    <font size='5'>


    </font>Yours forever,

    Elsi.</font>
