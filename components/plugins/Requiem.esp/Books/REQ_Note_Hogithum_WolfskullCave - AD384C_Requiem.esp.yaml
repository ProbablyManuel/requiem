    </font>The queen; 'twas she they'd come to see.

    "I hope," the Bosmer said,

    "She doesn't know of her hidden foe

    Or the bounty on her head."

    They wondered why she had to die

    And drank deep of their beer;

    Her subjects quaffed and raised aloft

    Their tankards in good cheer.<font size='7'>


    </font>"Such merriment, and yet we're sent

    To bring it to an end.

    But still, we're paid. To our charade,"

    The Orc said. "Come, my friend.

    We'll find the queen and when she's seen

    Our trick, she'll volunteer;

    Let's quench our thirst together first

    And join her in a beer."
