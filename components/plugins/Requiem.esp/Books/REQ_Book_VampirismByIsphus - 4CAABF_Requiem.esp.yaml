    Vampirism is a disease that affects the living, but unlike most plagues, this one does not abandon its victims even after their demise. While there are several variants of said disease, only the one known as Sanguine Vampiris is present in Skyrim, since the clans who live in the province keep any competition away from the region. As with most cases of undeath, subjects' bodies are cold and flammable, which makes said creatures weak against regular fire and most especially sunfire. They are also vulnerable to silver, and are unable to heal wounds through natural means.


    The life, or lack thereof, of these creatures is complicated in itself, as the need to feed forces them into hiding along roads where they prey upon travelers. More powerful aggregations keep thralls to serve as cattle in heavily guarded locations. Recently some of them have figured a way to keep blood fresh with the use of a special vial made of malachite, gold, salt and the spittle of a frostbite spider.


    Though several accounts of the origins of vampirism are known, their provenance is certainly Daedric. For this, and for their Padomaic influence on Tamriel, the Aedra evince particular hatred of these creatures. In fact, shrines dedicated to the Aedric deities have a similar effect to that of the sun, though on a much smaller scale. Some holy sites also inflict a sun-like damage to vampiric beings, and it is said that even Lorkhan, known as Shor, Shezarr and other names, shunned them. Students of the Doom Drum, who will remember his role in bringing mortality to this plane in the first place, will not be surprised to find that sites dedicated to this trickster god are also inimicable.


    As if these limitations of the disease were not enough of a hindrance, society shuns Daedric threats of all kinds, so it is no surprise that vampires are ill received and will often be attacked on sight if their symptoms become apparent. While a starving vampire is obvious due to their prominent veins and the exposure of their sharp teeth, well-fed vampires are not recognized as such, and thus have a greater chance to remain undetected by citizens.


    Now, these small inconveniences should not prevent those who lack power and who have the will to achieve it by their own means from seeking out this disease. For those who are willing to endure a curse upon their body and soul in exchange for power, there are quite a few ways to achieve this goal. The most common method of infection for a healthy person is by direct contact with an afflicted, perhaps through combat, though one must survive the confrontation in order to even notice the sickness. It is also possible to ask a known vampire to infect without killing, which is much safer if a willing participant is found. However, this also carries risk. Most vampires found in the wild rarely encounter mortals, and will attack on sight to fill their thirst. Lastly, one could ingest the ashes of a fallen vampire, which has a chance to inflict the disease. But beware: many an inexperienced alchemist has died almost instantly, thinking vampire dust only as harmful as the usual poisonous root.  


    Perhaps, for some, it is worth the risk. The biggest advantage of undeath is the complete invulnerability to disease and aging. While this may seem less useful than increased vitality, anyone who has faced one of the fiends in battle knows that most of them have lived beyond their years, accumulating lethal experience in both magical and martial arts. This is why none other than the finest warriors and magi should approach an unknown vampire, and even then preparation and knowledge are required. And this is why I leave you with this, for knowledge will be your best weapon where vampires are concerned, whether you fight against them or join them in their ranks.
