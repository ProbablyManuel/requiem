    <p align="center"><u>Leather</u></p>


    If you want to get started with smithing, leather's the easiest to work with. Everyone knows that cow leather is good, thick leather, but you can make leather from just about any animal with a thick enough skin.


    First you need a tanning rack. Then you stretch the skin over the rack, and scrape off all the hair and fat. Then you soak it a bit in some water. It can't be plain water. It has to be water with something in it. You can put limestone in it. You'll know if it's limestone because wherever you'll be will have lots of caves. If you dig the rock above the cave, it's probably limestone. If you haven't got any limestone, you can use potash. That's just wood ash, in a pot. Whatever you use, you leave the leather in it and it goes a bit dark. The longer you leave it, the more leathery it gets.


    If you don't have time to tan leather, you can just use the hide. Raw hide isn't very flexible, though, and it shrinks when it dries. If you get it wet, it gets flexible again and it starts to fall apart. You can put it on a cast and it will dry in exactly the right shape. It isn't as thick as leather but it will keep you warm and if someone hits you with something sharp and pointed it's better than nothing.


    If you want really thick leather, you can polish it with beeswax. It makes it very hard but really easy to cut and a bit slippery. Better still is to boil it, in water that isn't quite boiling, then you get really thick, dark leather that's hard and only a bit brittle.


    Remember that when you're cutting leather, if you get it wrong, you can't undo it. Start with big pieces and cut off the bits which don't look like the piece you want. If you cut and then boil it you'll find out it shrinks wrong, because it's really hard to get that right, so just boil the whole thing then see what you can make of it.


    The most important thing about leather crafting is that you make something out of the leather that you've got. If you start making a cuirass or boots and you find you don't have leather that works for it, just wait till you get leather that does work, and make something else instead. Probably if you've got a big cow hide you'll find you've got the cuirass you wanted and lots of tiny bits on the ends which make good fingers for gauntlets. I always ended up making a lot of gauntlets when I was an apprentice.


    <p align="center"><u>Iron</u></p>


    The hardest thing about iron is getting all of the bits which aren't iron out of it.

    First, you want to melt the ore. Then when it's melted, you leave the bits floating on top and let the iron come out. A good smelter keeps the iron away from the fuel, and it has a door that opens up and lets the melted iron out of the bottom but keeps the stuff that isn't iron floating on top.


    If you get too much soot in the iron, it's really brittle and then it breaks and that's no good. That's why iron armor isn't as good as steel armor, because even though it's harder it shatters more easily. It's easier to make though because you don't have to worry too much about the soot.

    There are two ways to make iron: cast iron, and wrought iron. Cast iron is good if it's got lots of soot in it. Smiths who aren't really good at hammering do it this way. You make a mould out of sand, then you pour the molten iron in, and then you let it set.


    Really good smiths learn how to make wrought iron. You have to hammer the iron really hard, and then heat it and do it again. All the bits which aren't iron will get spat out, and all the air, and you end up with very thick, dense iron. It's hard to do though, and it takes a strong arm, and you have to watch out for the bits because they really do spit quite far and they're molten iron, and that can hurt a bit. The most important thing about iron crafting is that it takes a lot of iron ore to get anything good.


    <p align="center"><u>Steel</u></p>


    Steel is iron with hardly any soot in it at all. It's tricky to make. You need to get the soot to about one in fifty parts. That makes really good steel. You can't just smelt steel like iron either. A really good smelter has pipes that heat the iron just with the hot air and don't let it touch any of the fuel, because the fuel's got lots of soot in it. Most of making steel is about avoiding the soot.


    The best steel is forged cold, but that's even harder to do than with iron. You hammer, and as you hammer, the steel heats up, and you press it into a mould. The more soot you have in the steel, the less it will press, but the more soot you have, the harder the edge will be. So really good swords are very tricky to make, because you want them hammered over and over to get the shape, but you want them to have a hard edge too.


    The best swords aren't just bashed into a mould, but are folded over and over again and shaped and take a long time to make. But if you're reading this book, it's because you want to be a smith, and you already knew that.


    The most important thing about steel crafting is that you have to really want to do it, because it takes a while and your shoulders hurt a lot afterwards.

    <p align="center"><u>Being a smith</u></p>


    I've been a smith for twenty years, and the best advice I can give to a new smith is not to be afraid of the forge. I don't have the skill of some smiths but I've still kept a lot of the soldiers here alive, and earnt enough money to bring up me and Rosalla and the babes.


    When you make armor and weapons for the first time, you'll want to know how to do it so that they don't break. Eventually everything breaks. Just make it so you can see when it's breaking and fix it easily. Some smiths know how to make really solid armor that doesn't break but I don't and I've never needed to. This is really important advice for iron because it breaks a lot.


    The other best advice is to be nice to people, because then they buy more things from you. Smiths have to be the nicest people in the whole of Tamriel, because we're big and strong and we play with hot metal and people can be scared of that. So be nice.


    A lot of new smiths want to know how to forge without getting burnt. You can't. Get used to it. The sparks only hurt for a few years or so, and then you don't notice any more.
