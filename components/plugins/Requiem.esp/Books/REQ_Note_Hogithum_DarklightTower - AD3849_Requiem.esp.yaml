    And climbed upon the stand.

    The curtain raised, the crowd amazed

    To see their queen so grand.

    The first knife missed, the second kissed

    A lock of hair, which fell.

    The blade had run her through.

    But look! It's not my fault.

    The Elf did shout. Without a doubt

    He wanted this assault.
