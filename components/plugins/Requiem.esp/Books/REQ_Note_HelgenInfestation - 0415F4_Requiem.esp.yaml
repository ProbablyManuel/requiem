    <font face='$HandwrittenFont'>By the Emperor, how could those bloody recruits forget to check the escape tunnel during the last weeks? We barely lost one of our men when we found out that the whole place is infested with spiders and other kinds of vermin! And this during the presence of a general! By the divines, we have to get that situation under control!


    I suggest you keep the tunnel sealed until the barrel with potions arrives so you can equip your men to right this mess. I expect the tunnel to be cleared by afternoon, and I won't hesitate to let you pay for my expenses - and remember: I will not tolerate such inattentiveness in my outpost. I hope I made myself clear...


    Signed,


    Officer Markus Glavius



    PS: Keep an eye on that old maggot of torture master. Not that he's become quite crazy during the last months, we also assume that he hid the key to the cages somewhere so he can steal the prisoners' belongings, which have been disappearing lately. If this proves to be true, you'll have the honor of giving him a... proper therapy.
