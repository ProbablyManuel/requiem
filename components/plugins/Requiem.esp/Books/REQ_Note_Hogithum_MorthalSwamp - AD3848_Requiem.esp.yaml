    </font><font size='17'>You die for this, who made me miss!"

    Another knife he flung

    But then he heard a murmured word -

    "Keep still your lying tongue.

    It took one glance, oh Necromance,

    For me to know your art.

    Now watch me prove my power. Remove

    This knife that's in my heart."<font size='7'>


    </font>As in a dream, he tried to scream

    But could not move or squeal

    Except to take the knife - not fake

    But hardened, bloody steel.

    "But how?" he said. "I am not dead."

    And she replied, "You are.

    You see, my dear, you drank the beer

    Laced through with cinnabar."
