    The Gibbet


    A human shaped cage is also known as a gibbet. It can be used as a form of torture, exposing subjects to the elements, animals, and hunger and thirst. It can also be used as a method of close confinement and public humiliation. Finally it can be used as a punishment, supplementary to execution, generally as a deterrent to others. Gibbeting is a common punishment in Skyrim, imposed upon unlawful subjects by Jarls or insubordinate bandits by their leaders.


    The Crushing Device


    Such Devices exist for crushing many parts of the body, but the most common feature screw equipment or vices for crushing a subject's limbs. The crushing can also be achieved by hammering wedges into constrained spaces where the limbs are confined. Similar tools resembling nut crackers can also inflict significant pain when applied to various parts of the body.


    The Feathering Punishment


    Tarring and feathering is a physical punishment. It is used in more rural areas in a few of Tamriel's provinces. In a typical tar-and-feathers attack, the subject of a crowd's anger is stripped to his waist. Hot tar is poured or painted onto the person while he is immobilised. Then, the subject either has feathers thrown on him or is rolled around on a pile of feathers so that they stick to the sticky tar. Often, the subject is paraded around town on a cart or a rail. The aim is to inflict enough pain and humiliation on a person to cause him to either reform his behaviour or leave town.


    The Branding Iron


    Branding is the process in which a mark is burned into the skin of a subject, thus marking it permanently. This can best be achieved using a very hot or very cold branding piece of iron or corundum.


    The Chaining Method


    Simply restricting movement is a form of torture - the more restrictive the constraint, the more severe the pain of the subject, as the subjects cannot turn to look in certain directions, they cannot open or close their eyes, they cannot make themselves comfortable by moving or dressing or undressing, or scratching an itch, or moving inside or outside. They cannot make adjustments for heat or cold, or light or dark, or ease their bowels. They cannot defend themselves against physical abuse. They cannot shoo away insects or rats. They cannot eat or drink easily, and in some cases cannot eat or drink at all - leading to death within days. 


    The Scold's Bridle


    A scold's bridle is an iron muzzle or cage for the head with an iron curb-plate directed into the mouth, pressing down on top of the subject's tongue. The 'curb-plate' can be studded with spikes so that if the tongue remains lying calmly in place, it inflicts a minimum of pain. This is often used to prevent prisoners from annoying guards.


    The Chair


    There are many variants of the chair, though they all have hundreds if not thousands of spikes covering the back, arm-rests, seat, leg-rests, and foot-rests. The subject's wrists are tied to the chair and bars push its arms against arm-rests for the spikes to penetrate the flesh. In some versions of the chair, there are holes under the chair's bottom where the torturer may place red hot coal to cause severe burns. In other versions weights can be placed on the subject's thighs or feet. In some, there even are spikes on the head rest.


    The Denailing Device


    The forcible extraction of the fingernails or toenails, or both, is a favourite method of Black Marsh's torturers. In its simplest form, the torture is conducted by constraining the subject on a tabletop and using metal forceps or pliers (heated red-hot) to grasp each nail in turn and tear it from the finger or toe. A more painful variant used in Blackmarsh introduces a sharp wedge of wood or metal between the flesh and each nail. The wedge then is slowly hammered ever further under the nail until it is torn free.


    The Orichalcum Bull


    Rumors state that the Bull was invented in Orsinum by Guralk gro-Gurbash the Cruel. Guralk proposed his idea of a painful means of execution to his brother, Gir'brask, the Tyrant. Gir'brask liked the idea of the Orichalcum Bull, and ordered his personal blacksmith to craft one. Once finished, Gir'brask ordered it to be tested on Guralk himself. The Bull itself is made wholly of Orichalcum and is hollow, furnished with a door in the side. When a subject is placed inside it, he or she will be roasted to death by a fire lit underneath. A system of tubes makes the subject's screams sound like an infuriated bull, and also will make the bull's muzzle snort smoke. 


    The Pale


    Impalement is a method of torture and execution in which a subject is pierced with a long stake. Penetration can be through the sides, from the bottom, or through the mouth. This method leads to a very slow but painful death. The subject also can be hoisted into the air after partial impalement. Gravity and the subject's own struggles will cause them to slide down the pole. Death can take many days, however. Impalement is mostly practised in Hammerfell.

    The Wooden Horse


    A wooden horse is a torture device of which there exist several variations. The first is a sharply angled device with the sharp point of the angle pointing upward, mounted on a saw-horse like support. The subject is made to straddle the triangular "horse", placing their full body weight on the point of the angle. Weights or additional restraints can be added to keep the subject from falling off.


    The Instep Borer


    The instep borer is a rarely used Cyrodilian instrument of torture that externally resembles an iron boot. It is hinged to permit the insertion and removal of the bare foot. A crank projected from a housing over the instep, which conceales a long, thick, serrated iron blade, grooved so as to inflict maximum pain. Turning the crank slowly advances the blade into the boot, punching a hole through the centre of the instep.


    The Boiling Water 


    A large Cauldron is filled with water, oil, tar, tallow or molten lead. The liquid is then boiled while the subject is placed in the cauldron or hung into it, head-first, when the liquid is already boiling. An effective way to execute a prisoner and to terrify his comrades.


    The Breaking Wheel


    A method originating from Highrock. The subject is placed on a cart-wheel with their limbs stretched out along the spokes over two sturdy wooden beams, with an additional beam for Argonians and Khajiit. The wheel is made to slowly revolve. Through the openings between the spokes, the executioner hits the subject with an iron hammer that easily breaks their bones. This process is repeated several times for each single limb. Once the bones are broken, the subject can left on the wheel to die. It can take hours, even days, before shock and dehydration causes death.


    The Burning Agony


    The subject's feet can be held to a fire, or trapped into metal boots that are heated up, or they can be strapped into an iron chair with a fire lit underneath, or red hot irons can be applied to their eyes. Metal torture devices can also be heated - pincers, pliers and so on. Burning or molten liquids can also by used, the subjects being forced to dip limbs in them or even having them poured down their throats.


    The Cradle


    The Cradle is often attributed to the Thalmor. It is a tall, stool shaped device with a metal or wooden pyramid on top. The subject is stripped, bound with ropes, and suspended above the device. They are then lowered, usually very slowly, on to the device, making the pyramid enter the body. The amount of pain the device inflicts can be changed in several ways. The subjects can be rocked, they can be dropped repeatedly onto the device, one leg can be lifted, oil can be spread on the pyramid, or iron weights can be hung from the subject's legs. To prolong torture, the subject can be suspended above the device overnight so that the torture can continue the next morning.


    The Flaying Knife


    A sharp knife - preferably heated up - can be used to cut off the subject's skin or any other of their organs. For the highest amount of pain, the eyes can be cut out. Other possibilities are cutting off the ears, the tongue, the fingers or toes, opening the nose or other sensitive parts of the subject's body. In Skyrim, ancient embalming tools are often used for the same purpose.


    The Heretic's Fork


    The Heretic's Fork is a torture device consisting of a length of metal with two opposed "forks" as well as an attached belt or strap. The device is placed between the breast bone and throat just under the chin and secured with a leather strap around the neck, while the subject is hung from the ceiling or otherwise suspended in a way so that they cannot lie down. A subject wearing it can't fall asleep. The moment their head drops with fatigue, the prongs pierce their throat or chest, causing great pain. Subjects are awake for days, which makes confessions more likely. It was first used by the Vigilants of Stendarr, who had been questioning daedra worshippers in custody. However, it has since become widely known amongst many of Tamriel's torture masters.


    The Iron Maiden


    An iron maiden is a torture device consisting of an iron cabinet, with a hinged front, sufficiently tall to enclose the subject. It usually has a small closable opening so that the torturer can interrogate the subject and torture or kill them by piercing the body with sharp objects (such as knives, spikes or nails), while they are forced to remain standing.


    The Pillory


    The pillory is a device made of a wooden or metal framework erected on a post, consisting of hinged wooden boards that form holes for securing the limbs. In the pillory, the head and hands are inserted in these holes. In stocks the feet are inserted. In some variations both hands and feet are inserted. The boards are then locked together to secure the subject. Different pillories can accommodate one, two, three or more subjects.


    The Rack


    The rack is a torture device that consists of a rectangular frame, usually wooden, raised from the ground, with a roller at one end or both ends, having at one end a fixed bar to which the legs are fastened, and at the other a movable bar to which the hands are tied. The subject's feet are fastened to one roller, and the wrists chained to the other. It is especially common among Cyrodiilian torturers.


    The Rats


    A cheap and effective way to torture someone is with rats. There are many variants, but the most common is to force a rat through a subject's body (usually the intestines) as a way to escape. This is done as follows: The subject is completely restrained, usually being tied to the ground or any horizontal surface. They then have slits cut in their belly. Hungry rats can then be placed in the slits to eat the subject from the inside. Gnawing the intestines usually takes hours or days. Unless stopped almost immediately, this torture always results in eventual death. Rumors have it that Orcish bandits like to apply this form of torture to captives deemed to be truly unworthy.


    The Saw


    The subject is hung upside down and then sawed apart down the middle, starting at the groin. Since they are hanging upside-down, the brain receives a continuous blood supply in spite of the severe bleeding.


    The Scavenger's Daughter


    The Scavenger's Daughter was invented as an instrument of torture in Morrowind in order to punish tomb raiders. It is an A-frame shaped metal rack to which the head is strapped to the top point of the A, the hands at the mid-point and the legs at the lower spread ends; swinging the head down and forcing the knees up in a sitting position.


    The Thumbscrews


    The thumbscrews is a torture instrument which was first used in Cyrodil. It is a simple vice, sometimes with protruding studs on the interior surfaces. The subject's thumbs or fingers are placed in the vice and slowly crushed. Thumbscrews are also applied to crush a subject's big toes. The crushing bars are sometimes lined with sharp metal points to puncture the nails and inflict greater pain in the nail beds. Larger, heavier devices based on the same construction are applied to crush knees and elbows.

    The Water Cure


    The Water is a method in which the subject is forced to drink large quantities of water in a short time. Often the subject has the mouth forced or wedged open, the nose closed with pincers and a funnel or strip of cloth forced down the throat. The subject has to drink all the water poured into the funnel to avoid drowning. The stomach fills until near bursting, and the subject is sometimes beaten until it vomits. The torture then begins again.


    The Intestinal Crank


    This method of torture involves making an incision in the abdominal area and attaching of the upper part of the subject's bowels to a crank. The crank can then be rotated to extract the intestines from the the still conscious subject. The outcome is always death, although not immediately. Minor healing spells can be applied to make the subject last longer.


    The Pear of Anguish


    A pear shaped instrument, consisting of four leaves that are slowly separated from each other as the torturer turns the screw at the top. The device is often used to torture liars and blasphemers. It is inserted into one of the victim's orifices. The four leaves can then slowly be forced apart. It is the torturer's decision to simply tear the skin or expand the "pear" to its maximum and mutilate the subject.
