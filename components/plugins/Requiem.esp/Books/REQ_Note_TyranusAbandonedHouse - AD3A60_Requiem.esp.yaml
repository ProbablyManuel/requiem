    This house and its inhabitants are under investigation by the Vigil. Anyone with information pertaining to Daedra worship and related activities may report to Vigilant Tyranus of Markarth for an appropriate reward.


    We do not advise entry at this time.


    To enter is to be doomed. There is no way out.


    Stendarr grant me mercy, for the Vigil cannot. There is no way out!
