    <font face='$HandwrittenFont'><font size='20'>I was twelve when I first knew that I wanted a dog. I was thirteen when I begged my parents to get me a puppy. I was fourteen when I tried to take one of Agath's new litter and they found me and made me bring the little thing back and apologise to both the dog and the smith. I was fifteen when I prayed to the Divines for a pup of my own. I was sixteen when I abandoned the Divines, prayed to anyone who would fill my wish, and found Dagger.<font size='14'>


    </font>The stray was facing off against a wolf. Neither of them had seen me. I drew my bow, and as the wolf advanced, I crept round the little hound and fired the arrow into the wolf's heart. I approached the dog I had saved carefully, so as not to startle it.<font size='14'>


    </font>When a wolf looks at you, it only has one decision to make: prey, or threat? A dog, though, when it turns those big brown eyes your way, has no decisions at all. It already loves you, and in return, you open your heart to it. I tore off a strip of meat from the jerky in my pack, and offered it to the dog. He sniffed and barked and took it, and that was it. We were inseparable... or so I thought. I called the dog Dagger for his small size and his sharp teeth, and he hunted at my side for fourteen years.

    He was everything I wanted: companion, guardian and brother-at-arms, giving me entertainment when I was happy and solace when I was sad. No lover was so faithful, no friend so free of judgement, no family so willing to oblige yet asking for so little in return.<font size='14'>


    </font>That's the thing about wishes, though. Their master is Clavicus Vile, and his servant, Barbas, often takes the form of a dog. I always used to wonder why, when I read that story. Now I know. All of Vile's gifts come with a curse, and Dagger was a Daedric gift, for sure, as all dogs are.<font size='14'>


    </font>Dagger fought as fiercely as any soldier, but the Imperials have sharp swords, and they struck us both down. I survived. They would not even let me bury him before they brought me here.

    [pagebreak]

    If you come to this place as a prisoner, know that I, too, felt your loneliness and your pain... and if you ever see a stray in trouble, be careful how much you love him. Dogs don't live forever, and they take your heart with them when they die.</font></font>
