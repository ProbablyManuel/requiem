    Legate Rikke,


    I advise you against wasting my men chasing after this fairy tale about the Jagged Crown. They say the crown is forged from the bones and teeth of ancient dragons. They also say Galmar Stone-Fist wears indestructible dragonplate armor into battle. Empty stories that poison the hearts of our brothers and sisters are all the rebels have. I bet Ulfric seized one of those Morrowind bonemold armors from a Dark Elf refugee and talked it up as dragon bone. I warn you, the only thing that awaits us in Korvanjund is a trap.
