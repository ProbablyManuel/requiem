    Damn it! This thing truly is something extraordinary -  both in a good and a bad way. I have the feeling that its powers have weakened since the day I... "borrowed" it. Those masterly crafted locks were nothing but child's play, but now the key just gets stuck... Luckily, it still works flawlessly on the others. It really gives me a headache,... Could those legends be true? That the key tends to abandon its owner sooner or later? Maybe it is also meant metaphorically? That it does not only get lost mysteriously just like that, but that it's powers decrease with use and time?
