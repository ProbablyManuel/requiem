    <font color='#440000' alpha='#ff' face='$DaedricFont'>Oberoth</font>,


    This is probably my last letter. I fell under the influence of <font color='#440000' alpha='#ff' face='$DaedricFont'>Hermeus Mora</font>. Studying his endless library, I managed to find knowledge that amazes my <font color='#440000' alpha='#ff' face='$DaedricFont'>mind</font>.


    I notice that I'm slowly losing my mind, looking everywhere for his <font color='#440000' alpha='#ff' face='$DaedricFont'>eyes</font>. They surround me. He does not take his eyes off me while I look for answers on how to get out of here and open the <font color='#440000' alpha='#ff' face='$DaedricFont'>gate</font> again. But it seems that everything is in vain, as if he deliberately hides a <font color='#440000' alpha='#ff' face='$DaedricFont'>book</font> from me with all the answers I need.


    I already lost track of time and <font color='#440000' alpha='#ff' face='$DaedricFont'>books</font> I read. Am I completely immersed in madness? Local <font color='#440000' alpha='#ff' face='$DaedricFont'>daedra</font> do not attack me, just look. It seems to me that they are only waiting for the order of <font color='#440000' alpha='#ff' face='$DaedricFont'>Herma</font>-<font color='#440000' alpha='#ff' face='$DaedricFont'>Mora</font>. But while I continue to search for answers to our questions, brothers and sisters.


    You will receive this letter as soon as I get out of here, I promise.


    <font color='#440000' alpha='#ff' face='$DaedricFont'>Razofoth</font>.
