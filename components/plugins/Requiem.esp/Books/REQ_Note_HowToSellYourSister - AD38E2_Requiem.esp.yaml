    Dar'irr,


    This one met your Breton friend as you asked.


    It was as you said. He had decrypted the part of Lithranil's journal which spoke of his admiration for Azinji. This one blushed to read it. Lithe and fierce, Lithranil had called me, and unafraid of even the most bizarre of situations. He said that Azinji moved like no creature he had ever encountered. He wrote that the time he spent with me was exhilarating, that the tricks he had learned from me would still make him smile in his old age, and that I was the most extraordinary Khajiit he had ever met.


    If only Lithranil had lived so long. Azinji misses him dearly, for all his pride and high-spoken words. This one did not know she was held in such regard.


    Along with the decryption, Azinji found a letter addressed to you which spoke of the Breton's excitement in meeting me. It is obvious that he took entirely the wrong picture from what he had read before! If your friend had decrypted the whole of the book, he might have read on the next page of my prowess in battle and the sharpness of my claws, and perhaps that would have given him a better idea of the one he had asked to meet.


    Khajiit is aware that some humans have interesting tastes. It would not be the first time, no? I think that his desire did not extend to Azinji, though. The man was terrified when he saw me, and immediately assailed me with his axe. Khajiit thinks he has spent too long in Skyrim amongst the Nords, since most sensible people, faced with such a demon, would run.


    This one was forced to defend herself, and Dar'irr, you must know that I could not lose any such battle.


    Please show this missive to the Breton, when he has recovered, and extend my sincere apologies. He left me with no choice, and Khajiit is most regretful. I hope that your factors were able to save his arm.


    With you though, my brother, this one is very angry. Azinji also found out from his letter that a deal had been struck for her "services", for five thousand in gold.


    Dar'irr, this one is bitterly disappointed. You wish to sell Khajiit? I am Senche-raht!


    Next time, charge twenty thousand.


    Your sister,<br>Azinji.
