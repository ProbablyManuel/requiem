    The reason my Da was no good at scale and chain is that he was no good at sewing, and had very big hands.


    Me, I have small hands, and I got brought up sewing. I got brought up smithing too, though. I seen the scale some of the soldiers brought back, and I seen slaughterfish, and I sewed those scales onto a shirt, all overlapping like the slaughterfish do. Two threads at the top of each.


    Steel's heavier than slaughterfish scales. The trick is to make a very big batch of them and make them thin at the top. The thread will snap before the steel does but it's easier to punch the holes then. They can't be too thick at the bottom though or when someone hits them they guide the blade straight up between the scales and that's bad. You hammer the edge of each scale down and then the blade goes up over one and up over the next one and your soldier gets to go underneath the blow and if they don't have scale or chain or plate then the other one dies pretty quickly. It doesn't take long to hammer it once you get used to it.


    With chain, there's no thread to snap. You make very thick wire by drawing out the steel. It's easier if someone's around to help, but otherwise do it on a cold day and it doesn't get sticky as you make it. There are lots of cold days here.


    Then you use tongs, and you make a ring and twist it at the top and bottom ever so slightly. Then the next ring goes inside that one, and the one after that, and the one after that. You can put a wire through the ones on the outside too so that they stay in place and it looks all neat. The twistier the ring, the stronger the chain, but you have to make more rings.


    If the scale or chain breaks then you just replace the chain or scale that broke. My Da always said that it was better to make armor that broke and was easy to fix, and he was right about that.


    He said not to be afraid of the forge, too. I think it's good to be a bit scared around it, and don't turn your back on it, and don't get drunk and fall in it, not ever. Not even if you're the nicest smith in Skyrim.
