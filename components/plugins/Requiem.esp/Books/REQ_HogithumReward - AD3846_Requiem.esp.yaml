    <font size='40'>

    </font>On Hogithum, magicians come

    <font size='6'>

    </font>To walk upon the stage

    <font size='6'>

    </font>That year, an Orc and Bosmer talked

    <font size='6'>

    </font>Of more than a wizard's wage.

    <font size='6'>

    </font>Though like the rest, these two were dressed

    <font size='6'>

    </font>In silk of shimmering sheen,

    <font size='6'>

    </font>They hoped their skill with knives would thrill

    <font size='6'>

    </font>The audience and queen.

    <font size='6'>

    </font>[pagebreak]

    <font size='40'>

    </font>The queen; 'twas she they'd come to see.

    <font size='6'>

    </font>"I hope," the Bosmer said,

    <font size='6'>

    </font>"She doesn't know of her hidden foe

    <font size='6'>

    </font>Or the bounty on her head."

    <font size='6'>

    </font>They wondered why she had to die

    <font size='6'>

    </font>And drank deep of their beer;

    <font size='6'>

    </font>Her subjects quaffed and raised aloft

    <font size='6'>

    </font>Their tankards in good cheer.

    <font size='6'>

    </font>[pagebreak]

    <font size='40'>

    </font>"Such merriment, and yet we're sent

    <font size='6'>

    </font>To bring it to an end.

    <font size='6'>

    </font>But still, we're paid. To our charade,"

    <font size='6'>

    </font>The Orc said. "Come, my friend.

    <font size='6'>

    </font>We'll find the queen and when she's seen

    <font size='6'>

    </font>Our trick, she'll volunteer;

    <font size='6'>

    </font>Let's quench our thirst together first

    <font size='6'>

    </font>And join her in a beer."

    <font size='6'>

    </font>[pagebreak]

    <font size='40'>

    </font>With one beer down they looked around

    <font size='6'>

    </font>And found her in the stand;

    <font size='6'>

    </font>They showed the trick, not true magic

    <font size='6'>

    </font>But merely sleight of hand.

    <font size='6'>

    </font>The Elf himself stood on a shelf

    <font size='6'>

    </font>With trust in his friend's aim;

    <font size='6'>

    </font>Knives thrown so well 'twas like a spell

    <font size='6'>

    </font>And certain of acclaim.

    <font size='6'>

    </font>[pagebreak]

    <font size='40'>

    </font>With two beers down she took her crown

    <font size='6'>

    </font>And laid it on the shelf.

    <font size='6'>

    </font>"They'll say I fear to volunteer

    <font size='6'>

    </font>Unless I come myself.

    <font size='6'>

    </font>But show me now exactly how

    <font size='6'>

    </font>Your volunteers survive;

    <font size='6'>

    </font>A fool I'd be to enter free

    <font size='6'>

    </font>And fail to leave alive."

    <font size='6'>

    </font>[pagebreak]

    <font size='40'>

    </font>With three beers down the Orc did frown,

    <font size='6'>

    </font>And bid the Elf goodbye,

    <font size='6'>

    </font>For none could know 'twas not for show

    <font size='6'>

    </font>And someone had to die.

    <font size='6'>

    </font>He cast the knife, then caught the life

    <font size='6'>

    </font>That trickled from the glaive

    <font size='6'>

    </font>And with a spell he summoned well

    <font size='6'>

    </font>The Elf back from the grave.

    <font size='6'>

    </font>[pagebreak]

    <font size='40'>

    </font>With four beers down the Elf did clown

    <font size='6'>

    </font>And bow and scrape and smile.

    <font size='6'>

    </font>"It's sleight of hand, you understand,"

    <font size='6'>

    </font>The Orc said, full of guile.

    <font size='6'>

    </font>"Just stand up here, and be of cheer,

    <font size='6'>

    </font>Your subjects entertained,

    <font size='6'>

    </font>My hand is quick, the knife a trick,

    <font size='6'>

    </font>The death entirely feigned."

    <font size='6'>

    </font>[pagebreak]

    <font size='40'>

    </font>With five beers down she spread her gown

    <font size='6'>

    </font>And climbed upon the stand.

    <font size='6'>

    </font>The curtain raised, the crowd amazed

    <font size='6'>

    </font>To see their queen so grand.

    <font size='6'>

    </font>The first knife missed, the second kissed

    <font size='6'>

    </font>A lock of hair, which fell.

    <font size='6'>

    </font>He aimed the third, and with a word

    <font size='6'>

    </font>He made the Elf to yell.

    <font size='6'>

    </font>[pagebreak]

    <font size='40'>

    </font>By just an inch he seemed to flinch

    <font size='6'>

    </font>The knife flew off of true

    <font size='6'>

    </font>Her hand she pressed against her chest;

    <font size='6'>

    </font>The blade had run her through.

    <font size='6'>

    </font>The Orc then cried, "My shot went wide,

    <font size='6'>

    </font>But look! It's not my fault.

    <font size='6'>

    </font>The Elf did shout. Without a doubt

    <font size='6'>

    </font>He wanted this assault.

    <font size='6'>

    </font>[pagebreak]

    <font size='40'>

    </font>You die for this, who made me miss!"

    <font size='6'>

    </font>Another knife he flung

    <font size='6'>

    </font>But then he heard a murmured word

    <font size='6'>

    </font>"Keep still your lying tongue.

    <font size='6'>

    </font>It took one glance, oh Necromance,

    <font size='6'>

    </font>For me to know your art.

    <font size='6'>

    </font>Now watch me prove my power. Remove

    <font size='6'>

    </font>This knife that's in my heart."

    <font size='6'>

    </font>[pagebreak]

    <font size='40'>

    </font>As in a dream, he tried to scream

    <font size='6'>

    </font>But could not move or squeal

    <font size='6'>

    </font>Except to take the knife - not fake

    <font size='6'>

    </font>But hardened, bloody steel.

    <font size='6'>

    </font>"But how?" he said. "I am not dead."

    <font size='6'>

    </font>And she replied, "You are.

    <font size='6'>

    </font>You see, my dear, you drank the beer

    <font size='6'>

    </font>Laced through with cinnabar."

    <font size='6'>

    </font>[pagebreak]

    <font size='40'>

    </font>"That can't be true. You drank it too,"

    <font size='6'>

    </font>He said, and then he saw;

    <font size='6'>

    </font>She pulled the peg from out the keg

    <font size='6'>

    </font>And poured herself some more.

    <font size='6'>

    </font>"I like the taste, and hate to waste

    <font size='6'>

    </font>A decent bit of brew.

    <font size='6'>

    </font>No more pretence. My audience

    <font size='6'>

    </font>Are waiting there for you."

    <font size='6'>

    </font>[pagebreak]

    <font size='40'>

    </font>With six beers down she raised her crown

    <font size='6'>

    </font>And placed it on her head,

    <font size='6'>

    </font>For no distill could ever kill

    <font size='6'>

    </font>A queen already dead.

    <font size='6'>

    </font>And in the stands the pallid hands

    <font size='6'>

    </font>Began a soft applause

    <font size='6'>

    </font>The Orc and Elf each joined himself,

    <font size='6'>

    </font>Obedient to her laws.

    <font size='6'>

    </font>[pagebreak]

    <font size='40'>

    </font>They'd wondered why she had to die,

    <font size='6'>

    </font>This lady of good cheer,

    <font size='6'>

    </font>For all had quaffed and raised aloft

    <font size='6'>

    </font>Their tankards of free beer.

    <font size='6'>

    </font>On Hogithum, their ghosts still come,

    <font size='6'>

    </font>Bearing what she brewed,

    <font size='6'>

    </font>With seven beers down, they toast the crown;

    <font size='6'>

    </font>The Queen of Solitude.
