    Giraud,


    Bad news about "On Hogithum", I'm afraid. Nobody I've spoken to on my travels knows all the verses. You were right in that it looks as if it originated from Solitude, but as you know from your investigations into the final verse, it's more complex than just a drinking song about an Orc and an Elf. The bandit groups provided me with the first verse:

    [pagebreak]


    <i>"On Hogithum, magicians come

    <font size='6'>

    </font>To walk upon the stage

    <font size='6'>

    </font>That year, an Orc and Bosmer talked

    <font size='6'>

    </font>Of more than a wizard's wage.

    <font size='6'>

    </font>Though like the rest, these two were dressed

    <font size='6'>

    </font>In silk of shimmering sheen,

    <font size='6'>

    </font>They hoped their skill with knives would thrill

    <font size='6'>

    </font>The audience and queen."</i>

    [pagebreak]

    Other than that, they seem to know half of one other verse, and nothing else. We can blame that on our friend Brodir. I'd go to Robber's Gorge myself to see where he found the fragments and whether he knows any more, but my leg still aches from the last welcome he gave me.<font size='6'>


    </font>Instead, I ended up investigating the Hogithum festival itself. As you know, it's a celebration borrowed from Morrowind. Its mention in Skyrim dates back to the third era, with records beginning shortly after 3E 110, though it seems Skyrim had developed its own traditions by the time the song was written.<font size='6'>


    </font>I find myself wondering if this song was written deliberately, as a warning to the rest of Skyrim of what was occurring here at that time. If so, perhaps copies remain hidden. Vanity can be more powerful than magic, and to see her history as a whole, from her first childish experiments with the mudcrabs of the swamps to her laboratories in places like Frostmere Crypt and Darklight Tower... I understand, now, how far she came. The knowledge is seductive, and powerful in its own right. I don't believe she would have destroyed something that spoke so boldly of her might.<font size='6'>


    </font>It's said that her madness even infected her nephew. An old Imperial report mentioned that Pelagius had ordered fifty copies of the song, only to burn them a few days later. I have wondered many times if we could find any surviving fragments in his rooms, but I wouldn't send my worst enemy in there.

    [pagebreak]

    I was tempted to investigate her old haunts, so to speak... but in this case, I advise prudence. Your second volume has many fine ballads, all of them newly gathered and most fascinating as they are.<font size='6'>


    </font>This song may be best left alone.


    Your friend,

    Adonato.
