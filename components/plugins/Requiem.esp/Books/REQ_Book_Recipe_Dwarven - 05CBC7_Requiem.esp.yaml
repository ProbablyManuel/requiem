    <img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/I_letter.png'>t was only in retrospect that I understood why the great statue we found had fallen apart as it had. We thought initially that it was the ice, but after research we conclude that the metal is completely immune to cold. Even steel becomes brittle when subjected to the lowest temperatures that my magic can sustain, but this Dwemer alloy shows no sign of change.


    It was the electrical charge all along, though it acted slowly enough to give the impression of having failed in its course. The timing of my ice spell could not have been worse in misleading us over these last months as to cause and effect. It is only when placed in electrical charge that the strange bonds within the metal finally begin to come apart, though sufficient heat will also melt the metal itself.


    The temperature to which the metal must be heated in the absence of such a charge is beyond the skill of the Imperial smiths, and of course, they have no access in the field to destruction magic such as my own. However, we found a way to generate sufficient sparks with a mixture of oil, gold and fire salts, based on a recipe derived from various substances found deeper in Kemel-Ze. Even then, the metal seems to retain some strange memory of the shape it held before, and it is easier to remold the ingots back into similar structures.


    There are plenty of automatons in the ruins, both partial and intact. We do not need them all for research. The disturbing sounds that accompany some small fraction of the melting are attributed to gases escaping the pipework.
