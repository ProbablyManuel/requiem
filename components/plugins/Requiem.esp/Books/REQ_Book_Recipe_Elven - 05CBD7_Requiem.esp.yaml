    That the Nords of this land have still not learned how to craft weapons and armor as light and resilient as our own is hardly surprising. They are, of course, more brutal in their treatment of ores and the resulting metals than the delicacy of moonstone will allow.


    In truth, to craft moonstone, one must treat it less like metal and more like clay. First the ingots must be ground into fine flakes. For more durability, a small amount of gold can be added. The finest work requires quicksilver, though obtaining the correct balance between moonstone flake and the liquid metal requires practice and a feel for the art that the lesser species cannot achieve.


    A small amount of oil must also be added, and this is what gives the substance its clay-like structure.


    Certain citizens, who have forgotten the beauty of Alinor so far from home, have taken to adding oils from rock or animal fats. Those of you who wish like me to obtain the highest form of the art should shun the practice, and focus on obtaining oils which not only produce the requisite ceramics, but also lend it scent and lustre. Jasmine, lavender and nirnroot are preferred. Beeswax may be used provided it is mixed with honey and queen's jelly. My experiments with garlic and snowberries were unsatisfying, and cannot be recommended.


    The result should be a soft, moist clay with the outward semblance of metal. Once worked, additional flakes of moonstone are rubbed into the surface. These will align, providing a hard and durable finish comparable to that of the towers of Alinor. Indeed, a similar approach has been taken in the working of Alinor's glass, the manufacture of which I have supervised for some years.


    Finally, the worked pieces must be left by the forge to bake, as in a clay oven. Only then can they be cooled, using clear salt water so that the works are not dulled by sediment or impurity.


    This dichotomy of metal and ceramic has taken decades for me to master, and I therefore remain confident that none of the baser races, with their shorter lifespans, will be able to achieve the same results.
