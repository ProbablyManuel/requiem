    <font face='$HandwrittenFont'><font size='20'>Your Grace,


    As you requested, I've compiled a list of the various people around Skyrim who are skilled not only in their arts, but in passing it on to others. Your initial remit was to seek out those who might teach our own Legionnaires, and I trust you'll find those names useful.


    Since our other business took me into Stormcloak territory anyway, I decided to include certain names from the cities sympathetic to Stormcloaks. These teachers are accessible, so if it emerges that Ulfric's men are significantly benefiting from their training, we should probably consider extending my mission.


    The obvious answers to your questions are of course that the College of Winterhold holds tutors for the highest levels of each school of spell-crafting; that the Companions in Whiterun are the best instructors in the martial arts; and that the Thieves' Guild in Riften is the best place to learn the skills for their trade. The Bard's College holds the greatest story-teller. Eorlund Gray-Mane's name, and that of his Sky Forge, are known even in Cyrodiil. Even so, there are a few small changes to our notes that need to be made.


    One of the Stormcloaks I befriended confirmed what we knew about some of the Companions, but interestingly, outlined their limitations as well. When I asked which of the Companions had taught him sword and shield work, he confessed that though he started with Amren of Whiterun rather than with the Companions themselves, his skill had surpassed even those warriors. For his own exceptional skill in sword and shield, he pointed instead towards the Orc strongholds of Dushnikh Yal and Mor Khazgur respectively. He claims to have begun learning how to move in his heavy armor in Dushnikh Yal, too.


    I was also able to uncover the names of those who had taught his comrades. Tobjorn Shatter-Shield, in Windhelm, has trained a number of the Stormcloaks in greatsword and battleaxe. I am also led to understand that the smiths of Markarth and Riften have some skill in their art, though nothing to challenge Eorlund.


    The Stormcloak also told me that he learned his archery from an elf in Riverwood, and indicated that the Companion Aela was not as skilled as everyone believed. He mentioned a name: Angi. Unfortunately at that point in our journey we were ambushed by Imperials, and I was forced to reveal your seal and my disguise.


    Our own men are of course my main source of information, and discussions with our battlemages have revealed a few surprises. As you know, I began my own study of destruction under Ulfric Stormcloak's court mage, Wuunferth, before the Great War, then graduated to the tuition of Sybille Stentor of Solitude. The battlemages confirmed that Faralda remains the most accomplished destruction master, but one of them suggested that the restoration magic of Danica Pure-Spring, in Whiterun, outclasses anything the College can produce. Runil of Falkreath is apparently a patient and kind tutor in conjuration, though he obviously knows more than he's willing to share. I obtained the name of Dravynea Stoneweaver for alteration. Unfortunately she's moved to Kynesgrove for reasons of her own, so we won't be able to access her.


    I think the biggest surprise regarding the conjuration school was finding out that Falion is still alive, and living in Morthal. He was the tutor of Phinis Gestor who's now taken the position of master in that school at the College. I don't think given Falion's powers that the student could have outstripped the teacher, though.


    As a reminder, and for completeness, my own small powers of illusion came from Atub of Largashbur. I still have fond gratitude for the Khajiit Dro'marash, for Revyn Sadri in Windhelm, and for Ogmund, who now works in Markarth. Without their lessons in charm and diplomacy I doubt I would have persuaded the Orcs to allow me entry.


    I'm also grateful for your efforts in securing time with the scouts you sent me. One of them confessed to certain criminal activities before joining us - I shall have to keep my source anonymous here. Again, we have confirmation of the mastery of the Thieves' Guild in all matters pertaining to theft and stealth. He mentioned the name of Grelka of Riften, a trader in leather goods, for his training in lighter forms of armor, though I can see from the way he kept adjusting the straps that he still has some learning to do.


    He claims to have been led down his wayward path by some of the Khajiit, who first taught him how to sneak into people's houses and break into their cupboards and chests; and by a beggar in Windhelm, who specializes in quick-fingered pilfering of pockets. He also revealed that Guild had one of the best archers in Skyrim amongst their little rabble, though he wouldn't name names, nor would I expect him to.


    One of the other scouts is a woman calling herself Eve, though I'm sure she has other names too. She was very interesting. The only names she shared were those of the apothecaries of Morthal and Whiterun, whose skill, she claimed, provided her with the many poisons on her person. She let me examine one of them, though, and I found its potency to be far beyond anything I've seen from our own side or Ulfric's. Whoever taught her isn't known in the cities.


    The other scouts confirmed that she was amongst their best, and I can believe it. At one point we were eating, and I lost sight of her for a moment. It took some time before I spotted her, tucked away in one of the shadows. Her whole demeanour is one of silence, from her short, quiet answers to the way she moves. Her armor has been altered, and fits her so well that it's practically soundless. I assumed she had learnt the art of stealth from the Khajiit, like the first scout, but she told me it was a beggar in Markarth who honed her technique. My questions on her armor elicited nothing but a small smile.


    I looked for her again after the meal, but she had disappeared.


    Her arts are even in excess of mine, and I would give much to know who taught her. Your Grace, if you find her again, please let her know that I'd love to spend more time with her. She was truly fascinating.


    Your servant, as always,
