    <font face='$HandwrittenFont'>The loremaster and the blacksmith worked tirelessly for the entire month. A shame we did not find the almanac earlier. The blade could have been even more powerful, but the quicksilver alloy must suffice for now. Even if it lacks an even more deadly blade, it still is filled with the thirst for the dragons' blood, enchanted to tear their flesh apart, to reap their very souls. It truly is our greatest achievement so far, and though I am not sure what strange rituals the loremaster performed to grant it this power, I am grateful for it. Grateful for holding a weapon that will make them tremble, make them wither like a flower struck by the unforgiving flames of the sun that shines upon Hammerfell's deserts! A true bane of the dragons! Dragonbane! That shall be its name!
