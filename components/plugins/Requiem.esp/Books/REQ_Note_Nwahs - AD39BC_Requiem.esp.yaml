    <font face="$HandwrittenFont" size="16">Rab,


    I know it was you who hid my silver sword. Did you think it would stop me? It was me who tracked down the rumors to this place. Me who found the golden claw. Me who stole it. Did you think you could cut me out?


    You don't even know if that blade is as good against undead as they say... but you don't need silver if the draugr can't see you. Two eyes aren't enough to spot me in the dark. You didn't see me go. They won't see me coming. I'm taking all the treasure for myself.


    I hope the skeevers take you in your sleep, you double-crossing n'wahs.


    Arvel the Swift.</font>
