    To understand how Daedric armor and weapons are forged, one must understand my journey. It is long, and takes you outside of the plane of Mundus and into Oblivion. Only there can the forging truly be understood.


    Twice, I have made this journey. Perhaps there will be a third time.


    First, the object to be crafted must be forged, using the blood of those gods that has fallen into the plane of Mundus. You know this substance as ebony. It is hard to find, and harder still to forge. This must be your first mastery.


    After that, you will need the heart of a Daedra. I suggest a Dremora as your best choice. It is important that you are stronger than the Dremora, not only so that you can slay it, but so that you can hold its will once it is bound to the artifact. This must be your second mastery.


    In addition, you will need a black soul gem, empty so that it may absorb the soul, and ground to a fine powder, so that the soul will be absorbed throughout the artifact. The object must be heated in a fire at least as hot as the one that was used to craft it. When the black glass of the ebony has softened, the powder must be spread evenly over the surface, and will sink into it. When it is hot enough, it will begin to glow, and your smithing has begun. This must be your third mastery.


    The heart must be cast into the fire. It will burst, blinding you. All the rest must be done in darkness, for you will not see it.


    The Daedra within will be trapped in the crushed soul gem. The artifact will transform as the Daedra struggles to escape. The ebony will contort, fighting, wrapping around itself, shooting forth spikes, and it will glow red. You will see this even through the blindness. This is your fourth and final mastery, and it is one that cannot be taught, only experienced. Bind the Daedra to the artifact, and keep it there.


    I strongly suggest that you do this in the hour before midnight. It is the hour of deepest darkness, in which the constellations combine to confuse the Daedra's will and make it vulnerable to your own.


    If you fail to master that fourth and last step, then the best thing that can happen is the loss of your forging, and all the ingredients. There are other, less predictable effects that may also occur. None of them will be good. Some of them are severe enough that death might be considered kind.


    The worst is the freedom of the Daedra you sought to imprison. If you cannot hold it, it will hold you. It will be very hungry, as I was. It will be very angry, as I was. It will kill you, as I killed the one who imprisoned me.


    It will not release your soul.


    To understand how Daedric armor and weapons are forged, one must understand my journey. It is long, and takes you outside of the plane of Mundus and into Oblivion. Only there can the forging truly be understood.
