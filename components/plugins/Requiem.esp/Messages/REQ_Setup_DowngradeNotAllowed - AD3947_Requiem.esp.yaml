    It seems that you have installed an older release of Requiem. Unfortunately, mid-game downgrades cannot be supported by us. You must either a start a new game or reload a savegame that was made before installing the newer version.


    Since your current game would become unplayable, we will send you back to the main menu. We recommend to relaunch Skyrim before starting a new game.
