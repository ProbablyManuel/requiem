    It seems that you have used a Bashed Patch to merge leveled lists. While a Bashed Patch can be used with Requiem, the Leveled List option must remain disabled because it will re-introduce leveled content into Requiem.


    Since this issue has a major impact on Requiem if not resolved now, the game will be aborted at this point. After confirming this message, you will be sent back to the main menu. Please quit and relaunch Skyrim once this issue is resolved.
