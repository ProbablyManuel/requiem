    It seems that you have installed a new major release of Requiem. Unfortunately, major releases (1st number of version changed) do not support upgrading savegames from previous versions.


    Since your current game would become unplayable, we will send you back to the main menu. Please relaunch Skyrim and start a fresh new Requiem-based game!
