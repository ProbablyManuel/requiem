    You are about to take a step when you hear a familiar noise. The cogs of Requiem seem to be changing. The whispering noise is almost inaudible, but it seems to have changed, as if some cogs have been switched for new ones.


    Again you feel that you should hold on for a few moments to understand what is happening.
