    Your Skyrim Script Extender is installed but it seems to be broken (executable-version: %.0f, script version: %.0f). Requiem requires a proper installation of the latest SKSE version to run.


    Since your current game would become unplayable, we will send you back to the main menu. Please exit, properly install SKSE and restart Skyrim.
