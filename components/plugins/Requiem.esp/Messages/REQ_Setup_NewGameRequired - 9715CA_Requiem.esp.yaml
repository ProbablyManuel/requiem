    It seems that you have added Requiem to an existing save game. This will cause serious problems because Requiem is a major overhaul and can only work properly when started with a new game.


    Since your current game would become unplayable, we will send you back to the main menu. Please relaunch Skyrim and start a fresh new Requiem-based game!
