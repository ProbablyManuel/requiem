  Value: "As your hand touches the stone, you can feel its powerful and ancient magic in every part of your body. You recall the tales about the Apprentice: With the fresh mind of a beginner, the Apprentice sees the world of magic with wide-eyed wonder. Being open-minded and accepting all magical forces allows a swift recovery of one's own energies, but also causes a severe vulnerability to less benevolent powers. "
