  TargetLanguage: English
  Value: >-
    A night of rest and a quality bed can give you a good start to your next adventuring day. After sleeping in a good bed, you will gather experience faster the next day. Resting in a player house or other safe locations like inns provides a higher bonus.


    You will also recover from minor injuries (less than 10% of your total health) when sleeping in a bed. To recover from more serious injuries while resting you need to apply the appropriate medicine before sleeping. Use a healing poultice, a potion or enchanted item that accelerate your natural healing rate and other restorative items to awake fully healed after sleeping.
