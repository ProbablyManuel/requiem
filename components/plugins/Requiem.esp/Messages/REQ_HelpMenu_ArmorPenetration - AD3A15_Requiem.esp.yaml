Description:
  TargetLanguage: English
  Value: >-
    Melee attacks and ranged attacks can penetrate armor, which reduces the effective armor rating and thus damage reduction of the target.


    The effectiveness of such attacks is determined by your armor penetration with the weapon type you're using. Per point of armor penetration you will bypass 1% of the target's armor rating with ranged attacks and melee power attacks. Standard melee attacks will bypass 0.5% of the target's armor rating per point of armor penetration. You can bypass at most 80% of the target's armor rating.


    In ranged combat the ammunition you use plays a key role for armor penetration. To efficiently penetrate armor with ranged attacks you should use crossbows and high-quality ammunition. The armor penetration of your ammunition is shown in the active magic effects menu.
