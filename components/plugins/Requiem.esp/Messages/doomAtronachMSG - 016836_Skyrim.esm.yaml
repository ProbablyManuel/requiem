Description:
  TargetLanguage: English
  Value: "As your hand touches the stone, you can feel its powerful and ancient magic in every part of your body. You recall the tales about the Atronach: It is said to be a great blessing, greatly improving spellcasting capabilities and granting a good chance to completely absorb hostile magic, but it does not come without a price! Stunting the recipient's magicka and causing a serious stomach burn, it makes passive magicka regeneration almost impossible and reduces the efficacy of magicka restoration potions by one third. It also turns eating into a painful task, negating all long-term benefits from good meals."
