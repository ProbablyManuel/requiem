  Value: "As your hand touches the stone, you can feel its powerful and ancient magic in every part of your body. You recall the tales about the Serpent: Always lurking in the Sky, it is fearsome and intimidating - and its fangs are as venomous as the depths of Pyrite's Pits. And those who bear its blessing are just as poisonous, and can call upon its power once a day to call forth a deadly bolt of the purest poison imaginable."
