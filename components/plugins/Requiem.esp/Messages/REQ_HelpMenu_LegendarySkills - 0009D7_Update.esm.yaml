    Please note that this feature from Vanilla Skyrim is not supported by Requiem. Some perks will not behave properly when you use this feature. Consider using an uncapper mod instead.


    Once a skill has reached a value of 100, you have the option to make it Legendary on the Perk screen. This option resets the skill to a value of 5, and clears all its perks. You get back the perk points for all the perks that have been cleared.


    Making a skill Legendary allows you to continue to level up your character beyond the normal level limit.
