Description:
  TargetLanguage: English
  Value: >-
    After all those hours of inaction, you begin to feel restless. In Requiem, waiting reduces health and magicka regeneration by default, but now the same penalty applies during sleep, and waiting is penalized even further.


    Normal activity will eventually remove these penalties, and it's generally best to try and follow a normal sleeping pattern. If you find yourself that your current enemies force you to repeatedly sleep or wait, retreat should be an option.
