    It seems that you have installed a new release of Requiem without rebuilding the Requiem for the Indifferent. This step is a mandatory part of the upgrade process because the content of this plugin is tightly coupled to the Requiem version.


    Since your current game would become unplayable, we will send you back to the main menu. Please exit Skyrim, run the Reqtificator again and then reload this savegame.
