    Coins have a weight in Requiem, although it is not shown on the item card in the inventory. Instead the total weight of your gold coins is shown as the weight of the misc item "coin purse" in your inventory. Every gold coin has a weight of 0.0025 units.


    When running into trouble with your carry weight, you should consider stashing a portion of your wealth either at home or in your horse's saddlebags. You can access the saddlebags by using Examine.
