    You suddenly feel a sense of apprehension as a mysterious sound enters your mind, like a machine of a thousand cogs starting to spin. Amidst that noise you think that you hear a voice speaking to you, whispering, "Requiem".


    You are overcome with exhaustion as the machine changes the Aurbis to something more dangerous but also more interesting and vivid. The feeling is overpowering; you need to stand still and hope it passes quickly.
