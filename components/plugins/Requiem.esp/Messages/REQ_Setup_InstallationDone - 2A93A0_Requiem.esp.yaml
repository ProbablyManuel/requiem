    After a short respite, you hear the whisper of the cogwheels subside, as if the machine has stabilized in perpetual silent motion. Whatever it was, it seems to have left an indelible mark on everything around you, from the highest Gods to the basest of animals and from the most arcane secrets to the simplest of tools.


    You also realize that you have been well saved. Your three skills are not as meager as you thought they were. You only need to focus on them, and you will be ready to start using them to their potential.
