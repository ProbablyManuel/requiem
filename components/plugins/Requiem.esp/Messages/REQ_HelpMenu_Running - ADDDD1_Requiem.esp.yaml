    Running reduces magicka and stamina regeneration by 100%, which doubles if not under the effect of any food, and scales with the weight of your worn equipment. If as a result your stamina regeneration is reduced to 0%, you begin to lose stamina.


    Vampires, werewolves, and those under the Sign of the Lady are not subject to the regeneration penalty.
