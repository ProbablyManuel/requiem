    Armors have two key properties: overall armor rating and ranged damage resistance. Every piece of armor you wear will contribute to your armor rating, but the ranged damage resistance is determined solely by your worn cuirass. Armor spells provide armor rating, but no additional ranged damage resistance.


    Armor rating directly reduces all incoming physical damage by 0.1% per point. Ranged damage resistance adds additional armor rating to your overall armor rating against ranged attacks. Armor rating can negate at most 80% of the incoming damage. All contributions to your overall armor rating are shown explicitly; there is no hidden bonus per worn piece of armor.


    You can check your current armor rating in your inventory screen. The ranged damage resistance of your current armor is not shown. Roughly speaking, ranged damage resistances are distributed as follows:

        - Low-level light armors such as hide or leather add 50 armor rating.
        - Mid-level light armors such as elven or scale add 100 armor rating.
        - High-level light armors such as dragonscale or glass add 150 armor rating.
        - Faction leader light armors such as ancient shrouded or General Tullius' add 200 armor rating.
        - Heavy armors add 250 armor rating.
