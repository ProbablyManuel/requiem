    Lockpicking expertise determines which lock difficulties you can handle and how easy the the lockpicking minigame is. Primary sources of lockpicking expertise are perks, but you can also gain bonuses from standing stones and potions. The values range from 0 to 10.


    The odd values 1/3/5/7/9 indicate you can unlock Novice/Apprentice/Adept/Expert/Master locks.


    The even values 2/4/6/8/10 indicate the correct spot of all locks up to this level is 8 times larger. This bonus stacks additively. For example, 4 Lockpicking Expertise makes the correct spot of Novice locks 16 times larger.


    You can check your current lockpicking expertise at any time in the Skills MCM.
