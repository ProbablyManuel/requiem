Description:
  TargetLanguage: English
  Value: >-
    A variety of creatures and some sinister humanoids can poison you with their attacks. Almost all poisons will damage your health for an extended period of time. More lethal poisons can also temporarily paralyze you, leaving you completely exposed to attacks. Furthermore, poisons also distort your vision and can drastically limit your orientation and accuracy.


    The strength of the visual distortions and the damage taken depend on the overall potency of the poison and your poison resistance. High levels of poison resistance also help you to resist the paralyzing side effects of many poisons. The more lethal a poison is, the more poison resistance is needed to resist paralysis and visual distortion effects.
