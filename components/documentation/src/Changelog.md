Requiem 6.0.0 - "Unbroken Road"
===================================================

New Features
------------

* Dragonborn DLC is fully integrated based on [Fozar's Dragoborn Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34829). Notable changes compared to the patch:
    * There are no additional smithing perks. Chitin, netch leater, and bonemold armors are crafted and tempered with the Advanced Light Armors perk.
    * The Acolyte Priests are on a similar power level as normal dragon priests. Vahlok the Jailor is significantly stronger.
    * Ash Hoppers have more plausible stats for a moderate sized insect. In return, their bite can paralyze in the style of scribs from Morrowind.
    * Rieklings deal less damage.
    * Armor penetration of lurkers, werebears, and serpentine dragons is reduced.
    * The All-Maker's Stones grant stacking boons that last while remaining in Solstheim.
    * Merchant inventories better represent the local economy.
    * Reavers are exclusively Dunmer and they are more likely to wear Morrowind armors.
    * Miraak's cultists don't seek out the player in Skyrim until the main quest is completed. However, the Dragonborn questline can still be started earlier by traveling to Solstheim.
    * The Ebony Warrior can be encountered after defeating Alduin, Harkon, or Miraak, or reaching level 50.
* Most food provides one or more long lasting effect that is determined by the nutrition of the food. Different effects stack with each other. The magnitude is the same for each effect so that there are no useless items. The duration depends on the meal type (e.g. a stew lasts longer than a single vegetable) and is generally more long-lasting than before. The nutritions and their effects are as follows:
    * Vegan: +40% disease resistance
    * Meat: +15 carry weight
    * Flour: Recovers 1 stamina per second
    * Dairy: Recovers 1 magicka per second
    * Sweets: Restores 50 magicka and stamina
* Alcohol does not dispel food but causes you to tumble after your alcohol level exceeds your base health.
* Most unique items have a unique model using assets from [ArteFakes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41254) and [Vastly More Unique Visage of Mzund](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3125).

* Crafting arrows and bolts requires firewood again.

Reqtificator
------------

Requiem 5.2.3 - "The Gathering Storm" Bugfix Pack #3
====================================================

Tweaks
------

* Fortify Magicka II reduces damage from all absorb spells by 35% but no longer negates magicka loss on hit.
* The Gauldur Amulet negates magicka loss on hit.
* Stendarr's blessing reduces damage from all absorb spells by 75% (was 100%).
* Sunfire Cloak reduces damage from Vampiric Drain by 50%.
* The spectral weapons from Labyrinthian are playable.
* Falmer melee weapons do not have their reach adjusted by the Reqtificator because it interferes with their AI. As a result, Falmer weapons have a niche as the longest one-handed weapons.

Bugfixes
--------

* Material bonus of dragonplate and dragonscale armor does not reduce magnitude of self-targeted shouts.
* Material bonus of Dawnguard armor affects all variants of Vampiric Drain.
* The invulnerable wisps in the Soul Cairn are not attacked by other encounters.
* Skill-ups from skill books, quests, and others grant a full skill-up in most cases. The underlying cause of this bug remains unfixable.
* Destruction cloak spells are correctly resisted when using Scrambled Bugs. It is still recommended to disable the "Magic Effect Flags" fix from Scrambled Bugs because it reinterprets the meaning of magic effect flags in a manner that is not supported by Requiem (or even vanilla Skyrim).
* Loading screens and tooltips do not use an unsupported ellipsis character.
* The new game check is more robust in large load orders.
* All absorb effects are affected by absorb resistance.
* Undead are not immune to some of Harkon's absorb spells.
* Dwarven automatons are immune to all absorb effects.

Reqtificator
------------

* Weight, height, and death item changes do not suffice to classify a record as a visual template during visual automerging.

Internal Quality Improvements (only relevant for modders)
---------------------------------------------------------

* `REQ_SunDamage` is assigned to all sun magic effects.
* `REQ_NoLifeDrainAllowed` is only assigned to magic effects.
* All deprecated record have the prefix DEPRECATED instead of LEGACY in their EditorID.
* Several unused absorb effects are nullified.
* Unused entries are removed from `Reqtificator.conf`.


Requiem 5.2.2 - "The Gathering Storm" Bugfix Pack #2
====================================================

Bugfixes
--------

* Armor weight penalty reduction from perks does not reduce damage taken.
* Synchronize with Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch v4.2.7. Earlier versions of the Unofficial Patch should remain compatible and the free Creation Club DLCs were not added as a dependency to `Requiem.esp`.


Requiem 5.2.1 - "The Gathering Storm" Bugfix Pack #1
====================================================

Bugfixes
--------

* Farkas doesn't drop his weapon in Dustman's Cairn.
* Werewolf abilities in human form don't apply in beast form.
* Companions quests forward the improved quest descriptions from Even Better Quest Objectives.
* Powerful Healing Aura doesn't have a persistent visual effect.

Requiem 5.2.0 - "The Gathering Storm"
=====================================

New Features
------------

* Companions radiant quests are restricted to bandit camps until the player has reached a sufficient level.
* All potential follower Companions have perks and equipment according to their roles, their dialogue and Requiem changes.
* The Vigilants of Stendarr are real daedra hunters instead of being daedra food. Using actor variations, tempered equipment and a perk-set that is well focused on their specialization, they can sometimes beat even the toughest daedra. They are not too effective against vampires though for lore-based compatibility with Dawnguard.
* Blocking and wards prevent poison from applying on touch.
* Daedric arrows never break.

Tweaks
------

* Running reduces magicka and stamina regeneration by 100%, scaling with the armor weight penalty. Then, the stamina drain is applied if and only if your stamina regeneration was reduced to 0%. The regeneration penalty doesn't apply to vampires, werewolves, and those under the Sign of the Lady. However, the following effects no longer outright block the penalty:
    * Fortify Magicka (Rank I)
    * Focused Mind
    * Fortify Stamina Regeneration
    * Windrunner (whose name is reverted to Wind Walker)
* Only the cuirass, helmet, gauntlets, boots, and shield are included in the Mass Effect.
* The first heavy armor perk reduces the worn armor weight penalty by 35% and the next four perks by 10% each.
* Casting spells in heavy armor no longer applies an additional unremovable penalty.
* The penalty for untrained spellcasting in armor scales with spell tier instead of effective mass.
    * Casting Novice/Apprentice/Adept/Expert/Master spells in light armor increases spell cost by 10/20/30/40/50% without the perk.
    * Casting Novice/Apprentice/Adept/Expert/Master spells in heavy armor increases spell cost by 20/40/60/80/100% without the perk.
* Wind Walker increases movement speed by up to +10% when wearing no heavy armor: head, chest, hands, feet (was +15% when wearing no heavy armor at all).
* Agile Spellcasting requires Agility and skill 30 (was Dexterity and skill 50).
* Wooden bows break only by weapon power attacks or creatures with mass at least 2.
* Health, stamina, and carry weight bonus of werewolves in human form is cut in half.
* Werewolves in human form have -50% poison resistance and 15% higher spell cost.
* Werewolves in beast form have -100% poison resistance.
* Fortified Muscles increases health and stamina by 50 (was 100).
* Alchemical Intellect increases magicka by 50 (was 150) and restores 1 magicka per second (was 3).
* Fortify stamina regeneration is moved from Fortified Muscles to Regeneration and the perk properly affects vampires.
* Spell absorption on NPCs is replaced by equivalent magic resistance because the random nature of spell absorption and its apparently broken interaction with multiple magic effects lead to frustrating encounters.
* Fortify Health II grants immunity to paralysis (was immunity to absorb effects).
* Fortify Stamina II grants immunity to slow effects from frost spells (was immunity to paralysis).
* Resistance thresholds of slow effects from frost spells are removed.
* Dragons have less polarizing resistances:
    * 75% resistance to their element (was 90%).
    * No resistance or weakness to the opposite element (was -75%).
    * 50% resistance to shock (was 0%).
* Dwarven automatons have no resistance or weakness to frost (was 80%).
* Ancient Knowledge allows tempering dwarven armors and weapons without the smithing perk and adds 150% tempering health to dwarven armors and 75% to dwarven weapons. All other effects are removed.
* Astrid and her disguised assassins use poisons of paralysis instead of irresistible knockdown.
* Giant slaughterfishes have a more believable size and it's possible to survive their bite.
* Enchantments are 25% weaker when Bend the Law of Firsts is active (was 45%).
* Mage Armor V has base magnitude 240 (was 0) and reduces all incoming physical damage by 50% (was 98%).
* Ancestor Guardian reduces all incoming physical damage by 90% (was 98%).
* Protection from Poison has base magnitude 15 (was 20) and cost 200 (was 150).
* Transmute Muscles has base magnitude 30 (was 20), but dualcasting doesn't affect magnitude. This was the only spell in the game that scaled both in magnitude and duration when dualcast.
* Extra damage of banish enchantments is doubled.
* Powerful Healing Aura doesn't grant immunity to absorb effects.
* Healing aura spells don't have a persistent visual effect.
* Building a Hearthfire house doesn't pass time.
* No message box is displayed when attempting to pick a hard lock without followers. Locks are considered "hard" if they can be picked with your current lockpicking expertise but would have a larger sweetspot if your expertise was a level higher.

Bugfixes
--------

* The Mass Effect is reimplemented to be robust to improperly timed equip events sent by the engine. It should no longer be possible to arrive in an inconsistent state under any circumstances.
* Exploding ammo stacks with enchantments and poisons.
* Vigilants of Stendarr don't carry 256 silver bolts.
* Ancient Knowledge affects aetherium armor.
* Mage Armor V isn't suppressed by lower ranks.
* Alchemical Intellect doesn't appear in the active magic effects tab.

------------

* Reqtificator warns if Bug Fixes SSE is not installed.

Compatibility and Modding Support
---------------------------------

* The Mass Effect no longer conflicts with other mods like Unlocked Grip or Equipping Overhaul.

Internal Quality Improvements (only relevant for modders)
---------------------------------------------------------

* Armor weight penalty reduction is stored in the actorvalues `heavyarmormod` and `lightarmormod`.
* All Mass Effect calculations are performed inside the script `REQ_MassEffectArmor` attached to `xx82CC14 <REQ_Ability_MassEffect>`.
* The workaround to force movement speed updates by modifying inventory weight is removed in favor of Bug Fixes SSE.
* A hidden, constant effect, self-targeted value modifier MGEF is offered for every (relevant) actorvalue, as well as a variant with a visible description. These are generic magic effects for use by abilities.
* Astrid has the Mutagen perks instead of the abilities.

* Enchanted ancient nord armor is restricted to Kvenel the Tongue.
* Dawnguard shield has no enchantment but can be enchanted by the player.

* Contradictory description of stalhrim armor bonus is rephrased.
* Description of perks that remove the spell cost penalty for casting spells in armor is rephrased.
* Description of Windrunner is rephrased.

Bugfixes
--------

* Strong Grip displays the correct magnitude.


Requiem 5.1.0 - "From Past to Present"
======================================

New Features
------------

* Extra armor rating against slash, blunt, and pierce attacks is removed. In its place high-quality armor materials provide unique bonuses. The first Evasion or Heavy Armor perk is required to unlock the bonuses. Each piece of armor grants the following effect, stacking additively up to four times. Shields do not count towards the four items. You can check your current armor material bonus in your active magic effects screen.
    * Aetherium: 8% less damage from blunt weapons.
    * Ancient Falmer: +4% magic resistance.
    * Chitin: 6% less damage from ranged weapons.
    * Daedric: +6% magic resistance.
    * Dawnguard Heavy: 21% less damage from vampiric drain.
    * Dawnguard Light: 14% less damage from vampiric drain.
    * Dragonplate: 9% less damage from the voice, immunity to Unrelenting Force at four pieces.
    * Dragonscale: 6% less damage from the voice, immunity to Unrelenting Force at four pieces.
    * Dwarven: 5% less damage from blunt weapons.
    * Ebony: +6% fire resistance.
    * Elven: Spells are 2% more effective.
    * Falmer: 5% less damage from ranged weapons.
    * Glass: +4% fire resistance.
    * Imperial Legate: Nearby Imperial soldiers deal +4% damage.
    * Nordic Carved: Spells are 3% more effective.
    * Orcish: Power attacks cost 6% less stamina.
    * Stalhrim Heavy: +6% frost resistance.
    * Stalhrim Light: +4% frost resistance.
    * Steel Plate: 8% less damage from slashing weapons.
    * Stormcloak Officer: Nearby Stormcloak soldiers deal+4% damage.
* Each rank of ranged protection provided by armors grants 50 armor rating (was 60). The ranks are no longer listed in the active magic effects screen. To this end, the ranks are reassigned as follows to provide a more intuitive progression:
    * Rank 1 are low-level light armors: Alik'r, Blackguard, Forsworn, Fur, Guard, Hide, Imperial light, Leather, Linwe's, Shrouded, Skaal, Stormcloak, Thieves Guild, and Vampire armor.
    * Rank 2 are mid-level light armors: Chitin, Dawnguard Light, Elven, Falmer, Morag Tong, Reinforced Chitin, Penitus Oculatus, and Scaled armor.
    * Rank 3 are high-level light armors: Ancient Falmer, Dragonscale, Glass, and Stalhrim Light armor.
    * Rank 4 are faction leader light armors: Ancient Shrouded, General Tullius', Nightingale, Thieves Guild Master, Ulfric's, and Vampire Royal armor.
    * Rank 5 are all heavy armors.
* Integration of the armors from the Dragonborn DLC into the mainland continues:
    * Bonemold armor has the same armor rating as steel armor but the same weight as iron armor. It can be bought from Brand-Shei and Revyn Sadri. Tempering requires the Craftsmanship perk.
    * Skaal armor has the same stats as leather armor. It can be bought from Birna. Tempering requires the Craftsmanship perk.
    * Stalhrim armor has the same stats as ebony and glass armor. Tempering requires Ebony smithing and obtaining the necessary knowledge in Solstheim.
    * Two sets of stalhrim armor are found in draugr crypts where an associated quest suggests the presence of a treasure.
    * Enchanted stalhrim armor is sometimes found in draugr boss chests with the Treasure Hunter perk.
* Perk descriptions of Block, Evasion, and Heavy Armor expose the gameplay effects. They use the following convention to denote how percentages stack. This is extended to Marksmanship, One-Handed, and Two-Handed perks too.
    * "X% less/more" means this effect stacks multiplicatively with other effects.
    * "+X% less/more" means this effect stacks additively with identical effects and is then applied as a multiplicative effect.
* Imperial Legates have a unique armor. Legate Rikke wears an enchanted set. Already spawned NPCs may continue using their old outfit.

Tweaks
------

* Armor rating of many mid and high-level armors is increased by 100 to counterbalance the loss of additional damage protections.
* Imperial, Stormcloak, and guard armors have +12/30/9/9/15 AR (head/body/hands/feet/shield) when worn by a faction member (including the player) ~to counterbalance the loss of additional damage protections~ because the officers have been drilling the new recruits.
* Hidden damage reduction is removed from Evasion perks.
* Weight of several light armors is increased to provide a more logical progression and account for the new material bonuses.
    * Chitin: +10
    * Dawnguard: +15
    * Dragonscale: +10
    * Glass: +25
    * Scaled: +5
* Slight armor rating and weight adjustments to have a more unified ruleset.
    * Armor rating of heavy armors is always a multiple of 100.
    * Armor rating of light armor is always a multiple of 50.
    * Armor weight of heavy armors is always a multiple of 10.
    * Armor rating is rounded in favor of boots and at the expense of gauntlets because as a result of the above changes the armor rating of a helmet, cuirass, or shield is always an integer.
    * Magnitude of Fortify Armor Rating enchantments increases in steps of 20.
* Ancient Nord armor has the same armor rating and weight as steel armor (was similar to iron) and is enchanted to reduce shout cooldown.
* Blades armor is enchanted.
    * Helmet increases ranged damage by 25%.
    * Armor increases armor rating by 130.

    * Chitin, Imperial Heavy, Morag Tong, Stalhrim, Stormcloak Officer, Ulfric's: Bracers -> Gauntlets
    * Aetherium, Alain's, Ancient Falmer, Stormcloak: Cuirass -> Armor
    * Studded Imperial Armor -> Imperial Studded Armor
    * Gold Jeweled Necklace -> Gold Amethyst Necklace
    * Silver Jeweled Necklace -> Silver Garnet Necklace

    * Hooded Monk Robes -> Hooded Plain Robes
    * Monk Boots -> Plain Boots
* Armor variants with small aesthetic differences have the same stats and name.
* Steel Shin Boots and Steel Imperial Gauntlets are removed because they are identical to standard Imperial armor in all aspects but name.

* Price of Wolf armor is increased to 5000.
* Weight of glass weapons is increased by 2.

* Disarming Bash has success probability exactly 25% and 5% respectively.

Requiem 5.0.3 - "From the Ashes" Bugfix Pack #3
===============================================

Bugfixes
--------

* Avoid division by zero when disabling the innate running speed penalty. This resolves the camera spinning around very quickly when using the mod "True Directional Movement" and similar unexpected bugs.
* Examine doesn't stagger wounded dragons.

Installation
------------

* The Reqtificator produces a helpful error message when a template referenced by an actor does not exist in the load order.
* The Reqtificator detects circular dependencies in actor inheritance trees and emits a useful error message instead of deadlocking.
* The Reqtificator will emit a useful error message when a plugin is listed in the load order file but doesn't exist on disk.
* Missing master errors are more detailed and specify whether the missing master is completely missing, disabled or loaded out of order.
* The "too many masters" error that can occur during the patch export explains the problem in more detail.
* Remove "Hide Activate Button" option from the FOMOD installer because it doesn't work in SSE.

Compatibility and Modding Support
---------------------------------

* Bashed Patch detection is more reliable. In particular, it no longer incorrectly triggers if the mod Glamoril is installed.
* Leveled List merger ignores records if a later overwrite has the preceding override mod as master.
* Carrying Dawnbreaker and Meridia's Beacon hurts all undead actors instead of only vampires.
* Remove unnecessary changes to vampire NPCs that interfered with automatically merging actor visuals.
* The threshold (sum of starting attributes) above which a playable race is skipped by the custom race logic of the Reqtificator is raised to 200 to support custom races with slightly higher starting attributes.


Requiem 5.0.2 - "From the Ashes" Bugfix Pack #2
===============================================

Tweaks
------

* Disable innate running speed penalty from the game in favor of Requiem's mass effect implementation.

Installation
------------

* The old manual is marked as outdated in its file name to avoid confusion.
* The minimum SKSE version check checks for the minimum version of the scripts required by Requiem instead of the latest SKSE version.
* The Reqtificator will no longer freeze when saving the patch in some scenarios, but instead fail with an error message and useful logs.
* The root cause for the ingame error "`Requiem for the Indifferent.esp` is missing" is fixed. The Reqtificator checks the load order for missing masters before patching instead of generating a `Requiem for the Indifferent.esp` with missing masters.

Compatibility and Modding Support
---------------------------------

* The Reqtificator correctly supports plugins that define more than two REQ-Tags in their plugin description.


Requiem 5.0.1 - "From the Ashes" Bugfix Pack #1
===============================================

Installation
------------

* The "cannot locate game folder" issue is resolved.
* The Reqtificator's error reporting while patching records has been improved. Error reports will now include the record that was patched when the failure occured and the last mod changing the record. 
* The Reqtificator provides more accurate information when finding an invalid reference inside a formlist.


Requiem 5.0.0 - "From the Ashes"
================================

The main feature of this version is official support for the Skyrim Special Edition. Other changes have been limited to the extend necessary for the port. The Skyrim Legendary Edition is no longer supported.

Tweaks
------

* The dialogue option to travel to Solstheim is restored to the captain in Windhelm.
* Miraak's cultists are only encountered in Solstheim.
* Dragonborn loading screens are restored. Loading screens that you wouldn't expect to see in Skyrim only appear in Solstheim.
* The Ebony Warrior is restored. However, due to the encounter's extremely high level requirement it remains effectively disabled.
* The old books "Zerus Morphus and the Helm that Wasn't" and "Zerus Morphus and the Chaos Wizards" are removed.

Bugfixes
--------

* Synchronize with Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch v4.2.6a.

Installation
------------

Compatibility and Modding Support
---------------------------------

* Updated Bash tags are added to `BashTags\Requiem.txt` because the list is too long to fit in the plugin description.
* Modgroups file for SSEEdit is available.
* Rule configuration files used to distribute keywords, spells and perks are processed in isolation. All the placeholders referenced in the file must be declared in the same file. It also is no longer possible to partially override existing rules by redeclaring their nodes in other files.
* Arrays in the rule configuration files only support elements of the same type, it is no longer possible to e.g. mix object and string elements in the same array.
* Playable custom races are patched with the basic changes required to be compliant with Requiem mechanics. For more advanced custom races, you should still consider using a handmade compatibility patch. Vampire variants of custom races are not patched.
* Requiem's assets are shipped as a BSA instead of loose files.
* The Reqtificator no longer allows priority-overrides in leveled list merges. The corresponding formlists `RFTI_List_LLMerge_HighPriority` and `RFTI_List_LLMerge_MediumPriority` have been deleted.
* Configuration files for the Reqtificator moved to the folders `Reqtificator/Config` and `Reqtificator/Data` inside the `Data` folder of the Skyrim installation.

Internal Quality Improvements (only relevant for modders)
---------------------------------------------------------

* Disabled content is disabled by comparing to the `TRUEGlobal` variable which is how the base game handles such conditions.
* Edits to Dragonborn tempering recipes added by the Unofficial Patch are removed because Requiem has no real reason to edit them.
* Tempering recipes for chitin armor have proper EditorIDs.
* Unused golden elven weapon meshes are removed.
* Clashing EditorIDs are renamed.
* Content of nullified illusion records is reverted to their vanilla state.
* Elsi isn't marked as unique because the Creation Kit doesn't allow this flag on actors that have a leveled template.

* Plugin description observes the length limit imposed by the CK.
* Detecting if a Bashed Patch was used to merge leveled lists is implemented without the usage of `Game.GetFormFromFile`.

------------

* Reqtificator doesn't display a warning if a Bashed Patch is detected.
* Ingame Bashed Patch check detects if the Leveled List option has been used.

Compatibility and Modding Support
---------------------------------

Requiem 4.0.1 - "Threshold" Bugfix Pack #1
==========================================

Bugfixes
--------

* The armor rating scaling factor is corrected, each point of armor rating provides 0.1% damage reduction.

===========================

* Vigilants of Stendarr wear the armor from [Mage's Plate Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/92916). They usually wear a full set of armor with useful enchantments.
* The Jarl's Longhouses in Dawnstar, Falkreath, Morthal and Winterhold have master-locked chests with rich treasures in the Jarl's room.
* The Halvar Brothers have a little background story. The Warhammer of Inebriation is a Nordic warhammer and its enchantment is only fueled by alcohol. Halvar the Other has his own unique loot.

Tweaks
------

* Armor rating is reworked to be more intuitive. Each point of armor rating reduces incoming damage by 0.1% (previously 0.12%) to allow straightforward calculations of damage reduction based on the armor rating. All existing sources of armor rating are adjusted to provide the same damage reduction as before.
* One-handed, two-handed and marksman "expertise" is renamed to "armor penetration". All values are adjusted for a 1:1 translation and tweaked as follows.
    * Marksman perks don't grant armor penetration. Armor penetration from ammunition is increased.

    * Armor penetration from the Warrior and Thief stone is increased.
    * Armor penetration from the blessing of Auriel is increased.

    * Ironhand Gauntlets and Irileth's Ebony Gauntlets increase damage instead of armor penetration.

Bugfixes
--------

* Falmer are reverted to their normal size so that they don't get stuck in their huts.
* Blacksmiths sell the indended amount of basic crafting materials.
* ActorVariations don't spawn gender and race variants that have no bandit dialogue.
* Blessing of Auriel lasts 24 hours.
* Orcish bolts increase armor penetration by the correct amount.
* Vexing Flanker doesn't affect ranged damage.
* Mystic Disruption doesn't mention irresistable damage because the perk has no such effect.
* Misdirection works on weapons that cannot be sold.

Installation
------------

* The ingame installation process is simplified. The ingame installation always triggers the first time the player closes the inventory or magic menu. Requiem will also periodically remind the player to finish the installation process. These changes should resolve some very rare occurrences where the ingame installation did not trigger properly.
* "Cobb Bug Fixes" are officially recommended to use and a warning will be displayed if this SKSE plugin is not installed.
* Ingame sanity checks for playable races are removed. These checks are now done only by the Reqtificator.
* The Reqtificator produces only a single log file to simplify troubleshooting.
* The previously deprecated `Reqtificator.jar` is removed from the distribution. The new Reqtificator setup introduced in 3.3.0 is now the only supported installation method.
* Ingame error messages for setup problems are more informative.

Compatibility and Modding Support
---------------------------------

* External configuration for the Reqtificator allows to disable the warnings the Reqtificator shows during installations like too many mods or missing SKSE plugins.
* The Reqtificator supports final armor ratings in plugins. Any armor that has an armor rating exceeding the type-specific threshold value will not have its armor rating rescaled. All armors in `Requiem.esp` have their final armor ratings assigned. The threshold values can be adjusted via external configuration.
* `REQ_AlreadyReqtified` is replaced by new keywords that provide the same features, but with more fine-grained control and clearly communicated effects.
* Player-exclusive perks are distributed via Reqtificator rules instead of a script in the core of Requiem. This allows mod authors to easily extend Requiem's mechanism to distribute player-specific perks and spells without having to create custom quests or use conflict-prone edits on the player record.
* Armor material keywords are transformed into armor set keywords. Every piece of armor is part of exactly one set.
* Each smithing perk uses a single keyword to govern tempering bonuses. The Reqtificator distributes these keywords based on armor set keywords. In cases where the rules defined by Requiem don't yield the desired outcome, the tempering keyword can be manually added to a record to bypass a rule for this particular record.

Internal Quality Improvements (only relevant for modders)
---------------------------------------------------------

* The Reqtificator can provide a detailed output of the operations applied to each record to help debugging issues during development. This option can be enabled in the "Other Settings" tab of the Reqtificator main menu.
* ActorVariations are restructured to use appropriate vanilla records and no longer ship any FaceGeom data.
* Spells are directly distributed via Reqtificator rules instead of being piggybacked on perks.
* The Requiem Core Scripts suite is distributed over multiple quests to improve its maintainability.
* The `REQ_SpecialEquipment` script is removed. All instances are replaced by the more generic `REQ_AddItems`.
* FormID of Potion of Cure Poison and Potion of Resist Poison is swapped so that Potion of Cure Poison maps to its vanilla FormID.
* Bandit loot uses compact leveled lists.
* The weapons of Vigilants of Stendarr are inside leveled lists so that other mods can easily add new weapons to them.
* Healing Poultices and the recipe are moved to a separate leveled list that is directly added to merchant containers.
* `LItemPotionCureHMS` is no longer used by Alchemists and `LItemApothecaryPotionCureHMS75` contains only cures.
* Armor variants have a template if possible.
* Unused lesser leveled versions of Nightingale Armor, Shield of Solitude and Amulet of Articulation are properly nullified.
* The non-playable version of the Worn Shrouded Armor is non-playable again. The armor is not worn by any NPC in Requiem.
* Targe of the Blooded perk has different priorities to prevent the CK from shuffling the perk entries.
* Various improvement to the bandit template system.
    * Look templates inherit proper gameplay data in case they are still used somewhere.
    * Gameplay templates don't have fancy names like "Bandit - Axe & Shield - Level 24" so that their names can be propagated through the chain of inheritance.
    * Template flags are added whenever possible.
    * Bandits without the Use AI Data flag have proper AI data.
    * Bandits without the Use Def Pack List flag have `DefaultMasterPackageList` as default package list.
    * Use Script flag is removed if the template is a LVLN record because they can't inherit scripts anyway.
    * Bandits use the vanilla LChar records as templates instead of Requiem's new LVLN records. The LChar records then point to Requiem's new LVLN records.
    * Vanilla wizard bandits always spawn as trickster.
    * Vanilla missile bandits always spawn as marksman or crossbowman.
    * Voice spawns contain the same races as in the base game.
    * Some edits to Hajvarr Iron-Hand are reverted because the (hidden) quest already takes care of his name and respawning.
* EditorID of all bandits are renamed to clarify their usages.
* EditorID of all armors are renamed to clarify their usages.
* EditorID of version stamp global variables are renamed to clarify their usages.
* KW prefix is removed from all keywords.

    * Hedge Knight
    * Imperial Hero Armor
    * Redguard Knight Armor
    * Skyrim Knights
    * Third Era Weapons (except battlestaves)
* Armor addon and enchanted armor records that are de facto ITM records are deleted from the plugin.
* Greybeard Robes added by Requiem are deleted in favor of the ones from the base game.
* Empty leveled list that used to contain silver oil is deleted.
* Dragonborn DLC tempering recipes that don't really belong into `Requiem.esp` are deleted from the plugin.
* Redundant guard officer outfits are deleted.
* Deprecated records are deleted.


Requiem 3.4.0 - "The Shadow Theory"
===================================

New Features
------------

* Invisible Entities have been reworked completely and are now known as "The Slighted". Slighted are Dremora that suffer from a rather special condition. They will now become partially visible after attacking or getting hit. The various encounters are linked via a common background story explained in several letters. One additional encounter with the Slighted has been added to the world and the existing encounters have been reworked. The Slighted will spawn even if the Invisible Entities in that location have been killed already.
* Healing while sleeping has been reverted to its old behavior. You will fully recover your health when you have an active healing effect while going to sleep. You'll also heal naturally if your health is above 90% when sleeping.
* Requiem no longer blocks the legendary skills feature. It is still not supported by Requiem in any way and you'll be warned that this might break some Requiem perks if you try to use it anyway. (We removed the SKSE plugin which blocked this feature to reduce our maintenance overhead.)
* Scrolls of Detect Daedra can be found for sale and as random loot. These work like Detect Life scrolls, but they'll reveal deadric beings instead. (Daedra are not revealed by normal detect life effects.)

* Spell Tome: Summon Invisible Stalker is removed. Mages who already know the spell can still use it. (The spell will be removed competely in 4.0.0)
* Summoning a mystic bound bow grants mystic bound arrows, which have much higher armor penetration power than ordinary bound arrows. (same strength as ebony arrows)
* Unarmed combat only receives the flat damage bonus from the derived attributes system. Stamina and health now contribute equally to it and the magnitude of the bonus has been increased to compensate the removal of the percentual damage bonus.

* Bandits don't use dwarven and orcish crossbows.

* Merchants are more likely to sell Adept, Expert and Master scrolls.

Bugfixes
--------

* Daggers receive the same damage bonus from the derived attributes system as other one-handed weapons. The derived atrributes system no longer modifies your overall damage multiplier.
* All experience modifiers are disabled in training mode. Skills will correctly advance during training.
* Various incorrect attack settings of Dremora are fixed. In particular they no longer use ineffective sprinting attacks that are not supposed to be used by NPCs.
* Priority of Pickpocket perks is adjusted so that Pickpocket potions and enchantments never reduce the effective success chance.
* NPCs can enter and leave the Atronach Forge in Fellglow Keep.
* Silver Tongue affects both buying and selling prices instead of boosting selling prices twice.

Typos and Grammar
-----------------

* Hadvar's and Ralof's artificial immunity to spider poison is removed.

* Paralysis immunity of Spriggan encounters has been moved to their races.


Requiem 3.3.0 - "The Quantum Enigma"

Bugfixes

        * Dragonscale, dragonplate and daedric armors have considerably reduced base armor rating.
        * Ebony and ancient falmer armors have considerably increased base armor rating.

* All effects that grant expertise are explicitly listed as such in perk, item or magic effect descriptions. Your total expertise for each skill can be checked in the Skills MCM.

* Each weapon now deals a dedicated damage type. (slash, crush, pierce or ranged)
* Each armor cuirass has its own weak points and strengths which determine how easy it is to penetrate the armor with a given damage type. (Can be checked in the active magic effects menu.)

Requiem 2.0.2 - "The Phantom Agony" Bugfix Pack #2
==================================================

Crucial changes to cumbersome coins and contracts, cloying construction, clandestine cups and other complications!

Other Tweaks
------------

* The FOMOD installer now allows you to select an optional plugin which will re-enable access to the unreqtified Dragonborn DLC. This plugin simply re-enables the cultist attack, the travel to Solstheim dialogue, the Ebony Warrior encounter and some crafting recipes from the Dragonborn DLC. 
* A large part of the reward for bounty quests is now paid in gems. Contracts on giants also pay more than they used to. Various other quests that used to give large amounts of gold as reward have a large share of their reward paid out in gems, including "Hail Sithis!", "Tending the Flames", "Aftershock", "Rise in the East" and "The Wolf Queen Awakened".
* You can now see and hear NPCs when they drink alcohol. (Bandits like to use the fortify health effect from alcohol as a health potion substitute which seemed like sudden unjustified health regeneration before.)
* The outdated Vanilla Shrines option is removed from the FOMOD installer. If you have used this option in the past you might want to use [Requiem - Blessings Ignore Crimes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50251) instead.
* Talos' greater blessing now gives 15% bonus to melee damage instead of adding a flat 20 points.
* Blacksmiths and fletchers have more common bolts for sale. Fletchers and caravaneers also have limited stocks of explosive ammunition in store.

* Tiny spiders no longer paralyze or use spit attacks. 
* The lunge attack of large and giant spiders paralyzes instead of knocking down. 
* Updated to USLEEP 3.0.13a. 
* The quest components for "On Hogithum" have been moved to more obvious places to make it easier to start and complete the quest. 
* The yield of stone quarries is doubled to 32 and each Hearthfire house has at least three stone quarries in close proximity. General merchants in major cities sell clay and quarried stone. 

Bugfixes
--------

* The quest "The Whispering Door" now proceeds normally after you acquired the key. (If you already opened the door and picked up the item behind it, the update will progress the quest to the correct state to recover from the bug.)
* The system penalizing excessive use of wait and sleep with reduced regeneration rates has been retracted. It turned out that this feature causes incompatibilities with other mods which let time progress, like Time Flies.
* The technical aspects of the new lockpicking system have been reworked. You can no longer be locked into an NPC's house. You will be notified if a lock is considered challenging for you. Compatibility with mods that use scripted activation-blocks has also been improved.

* Followers need the correct lockpicking expertise to pick master level locks.
* Evasion training works as intended.

* Deleveled some items from "Missing in Action" that were still leveled.
* Fixed various flags on notes and books added by Requiem.
* The USLEEP-added cooked boar meat recipe is disabled.
* Fixed an incorrect spawn chance for an expert alteration tomes leveled item.
* Savos Aren should no longer show up naked.

Reqtificator and Installation changes
-------------------------------------

Requiem 2.0.0 - "The Phantom Agony"
===================================

Our favourite overhaul has been overhauled! With USKP ousted we're now only usable with USLEEP, so dependent on all DLCs (though with Dragonborn disabled). With awesome archery, ferocious fighting, luscious lockpicking, hearthfire happiness, sumptuous snacks, lighter looting, banished bugs, gripping games, and one curious quest.

Highlights
----------

**Awesome Archery:** The Marksman perk tree has been rearranged and archery bugs have been fixed. The Ranger perk (previously Fast Movement) only works with light bows and crossbows... but it only takes a little skill to acquire, and sneaking no longer breaks it. Heavy bow and crossbow users will find their weapons less draining. Even novices can send arrows winging their way over a distance, unless you're trying to be sneaky. Different parts of armor provide different arrow protection, with a simple keyword-based approach that modders can easily follow. Boots and gauntlets will no longer protect your innards! Perks can help you to overcome such arrow protection and skilled marksman might even find some weakspots in the armor plating of automatons. And silver arrows, advanced bolts and explosive bolts have all been given a make-over and are now distinct and beautiful.

**Ferocious Fighting:** Evasion perks grant a reduction to physical damage and an increase in evasion xp gain... but only if you wear no heavy armor. Bashing perks work with both shields and weapon bashes. Fortify armor still further with enchantments. But it's not all in your favour: effects which were formerly the exclusive privilege of players are now distributed to NPCs, who can use daedric weapons, warhammers and maces to pierce armor just as you do, and some bosses are even more dangerous... even when newly risen from their sarcophagi.

**Luscious Lockpicking:** With a more gradual difficulty curve, various chests are no longer out of your reach until you suddenly find inspiration. While some chests may still defy your talents, others will require true dexterity, and several lockpicks. Friends and hirelings are restricted by their own skills... and their morals. Lockpicking bonuses from different sources such as potions and enchantments can be combined and some unique items and effects will also help you to coax open more challenging locks. Mages no longer have to deal with quicksilver ore if they want to use arcane arts to unlock a lock, but the new "Knock" spells have their own twists...

**Hearthfire Happiness:** Hearthfire is now fully integrated. The three Hearthfire houses are available at low levels... though you still have to do some favours for the Jarls first. They'll grant you enough material to build a bed for the night, after which you might have to do some searching; stone and clay of suitable quality can be hard to find! And building the houses will actually take time...

**Sumptuous Snacks:** The cuisine of Skyrim has been refined for the most discerning palate. Stews remain stupendous, alcohol amazing, Hearthfire's ovens are outstanding and getting drunk is just delightful. Strong Nords won't be double-counting dragons after only a single ale, and a gulp of good booze might give you a useful edge. But beware; too much alcohol might have unexpected interactions with your breakfast stew!

**Lighter Looting:** Gold can weigh down the body as well as the soul. Gems and jewellery are more commonly found and often more valuable, and more merchants are willing to buy them for a fair price. Armor is easier to carry when you wear it, and arrows weigh much less than they did.

**Banished Bugs:** From horses that sound like catapults to mountain flower trickery, from misbehaving rune spells to overpowered vegetables, a multitude of bugs and unbalancing tweaks including those reported have been fixed.

**Gripping Games:** The language and wording of Requiem-specific messages and descriptions has been reworked for easier, more immersive reading, from the Reqtificator to initialization, to picking your character and playing the game. Mage difficulty tags are reverted to vanilla for consistency, summon spell names have also been made consistent and more immersive, and vampires will no longer drop dead immediately just for touching shiny things. With a meaner, leaner MCM, updated descriptions that you can actually read, and several other requested changes included, Requiem games will be smoother and more believable than ever before.

**A Curious Quest:** While adventuring you find a strange piece of paper. It looks like a fragment of something eerily familiar, but where are the other pieces? Help the Bard's College reassemble the lost work... and find out what really happened on Hogithum.

**Legendarily Lazy:** We no longer support USKP, and as such require all DLCs. Note that Dragonborn is disabled; the quest will not run and no radiant quests will send you to Solstheim without a suitable patch.
